<h2>Korespondensi</h2>
<p>
This was the follow up between <b>Mr. RHA</b> and <b>Mr. DZ</b>.
Well... Mr. RHA had fun by <i>communicating</i> with those people...
Worth to read and good for few chuckles hopefully...
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h3>First email from Mr. DZ to Mr. RHA</h3>
<p>
FROM Mr. DZ TEL: +27 83 666 9226
<p>
TOP URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL
<br>
Dear Mr RHA, compliments of the day and how are you. I know my
letter will come to you as surprise. Please I need your urgent
assistance to transfer my dead father&#39;s money into your account. 
My name is Mr. DZ , the son of Mr. MZ a white farmer who is 
married to a Zimbabwean woman.
<p>
My dead father was a prosperous farmer and owns the largest 
farmland in disputed area in our country. As if he knew before 
his death, he deposited a total sum of Twelve Million Seven
Hundred Thousand US Dollars (US$12,700,000.00) with a Security 
Company in South Africa.
<p>
Prior to the time he was shot by the opposition party members 
of President A.M over the white farmers dispute. Presently, we
are living in South Africa as asylum seekers where I got your 
contact from JCCI (Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry).
<p>
We would like you to assist us transfer this money to your private 
or company&#39;s account to enable us come over there for investment and
safeguard our life too because the South African Government does not 
allow asylum seekers to operate or invest in South Africa. Based on 
this we are contacting you as a foreign partner to this venture. 
We have resolved to offer you 20% of the total money and take 75%, 
while, 5% will be for any expenses that might be incurred during 
the transaction. 
<p>
Please note that the only basis for this urgent plea is to hope that 
you can handle this money in strict confidence and trust. Meanwhile, 
our arrangement is to come down with you to your country on conclusion 
of this transfer. You may contact me urgently through email for more 
information. Waiting for your quick reply.
<p>
Best regards, Mr. DZ for the Family
<p>

<h3>Mr. RHA&#39;s Reply</h3>
<p>
Mr. DZ, 
<br>Thank you for contacting me with this exciting opportunity to
not only profit but to bring more peace to our troubled world. I am 
indeed a man know for my discretness, trustworthy and legitimate 
business abilities. I am flattered and a bit surprised that my 
reputation should reach you in Africa. You honor me by entrusting 
this noble endeavor to my discretion. I await more details on how 
to conduct the exchange of the funds you mention.
<p>
Your new partner,
<br>
Mr. RHA

<p>
<h3>Mr. DZ&#39;s Reply</h3>
<p>
Dear MR. RHA:
<p>
I am very sorry for my delay to your mail due to my illnesss in 
which I was admitted in the hospital but I am recovering now. 
Please bear with me. I want to let you know that i have contacted 
a banker who will assist in this transfer and he adviced that a 
non-resident Dollar account must be opened here first.
This 
is where this money will be deposited first immediately it
comes out from the Security Company before unwards transfer to your
offshore account overseas. So please what I need from you now is 
to buy your ticket and come down here to South Africa and open 
this account on your name, because my status here as refugee 
does not permit me to operate on any banking system, that is 
why i needed your assistant most. As i have promised to give 
you 20% of the total sum for your assistant and 5% for all
your expenses. Be resassured that this transaction is 100% risk free.
Thanks once more for your willingness to assist me. 
May God bless you.
<p>
Your truily
<br>
Mr. DZ.

<h3>Mr. RHA&#39;s Reply</h3>
<p>
Dear, Mr. DZ:
<p>
I&#39;m eager to start our new business partnership and claim my 
percentage of the $2.54 million dollars. And that is in US dollars? 
I mean to say has the number changed given the fluctuating exchange 
rate between our two nation&#39;s currencies? You are right in trusting 
that I will not sit on this money once it is in my account. I have 
never sat on any monies before and will not start now. Will I 
encounter any tax liabilities for receiving this money in my secure 
account?
<p>
Thank you,
<br>
Your new associate
<p>
Mr. RHA.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h3>Mr. DZ&#39;s Reply</h3>
<p>
Mr. RHA. my dear:
<p>
As part your question about if you will encounter any tax 
liabilities for receiving this money in my secure account. I want 
to let you know that if there will be something like that the tax 
can be removed from the money but the only place we will spend
money in this business is by consulting an attorney who will represent 
you here in the bank and in the procurement of the documents needed 
for the transfer.
<p>
This will not need too much money hoping this will not impose any
limitation in the proper functions of your duties.
Thanks and remain bless.
<p>
From your beloved partner.
<p>
Mr. DZ
<p>

<p>
<h3>Mr. RHA&#39;s Reply</h3>
<p>
Mr. DZ,
<p>
I have received similar requests in similar emails regarding moving 
a sum of $20 million dollars from your country to mine, perhaps there 
are several accounts similar to the one you are working with which 
each have a sum of $20 million dollars? Based on the emails I&#39;ve 
received lately it seems there is over 100 million dollars in your 
country in need of most safe transferring.
<p>
I was wondering, do you have any competitor in this venture?
<p>
Yours in future prosperity,
<br>
Mr. RHA
<p>

<h3>Mr. DZ&#39;s Reply</h3>
<p>
(<i>Note: He started to use all capital letters as if he was growing 
impatience waiting for the email and action</i> :).
<p>
DEAREST MR. RHA,
<p>
I REALLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERN MOSTLY IN THIS BUSINESS TRANSACTION.
TRULY ALOT OF THINGS ARE HAPPENING NOWASDAYS AND IT CALLS FOR THE
EMERGENCE OF CAREFULNESS. AS FAR AS I KNOW BEST, NO SINGLE SOUL IS 
COMPETING WITH ME IN THIS VERY TRANSACTION. THIS I KNOW AND CAN 
GUARANTEE ANYTIME, ANYDAY. IF SOMEONE ELSE CONTACTS YOU IN RESPECT 
OF THIS MY VERY TRANSACTION, THEN YOU BETTER WATCH IT OUT. IF YOU 
MUST RUB REASONS WITH ME AT THIS POINT, IT WOULD DO US A WHOLE LOT 
OF GOOD IF WE GO ON TO EXECUTE THIS TRANSACTION AT HAND NOW, 
THEREAFTER YOU CAN/ WE CAN JOINTLY LOOK INTO ANY OTHER MATTER
BUSINESS-WISE. LIKE I ALWAYS TOLD YOU, WE HAVE VERY LIMITED TIME FOR THIS
DEAL AND WE OUGHT TO BE AHEAD OF TIME. PLEASE, KINDLY SEND TO ME THE
INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR THIS TRANSACTION SO THAT WE CAN MAKE
PROGRESS. BUT PLEASE, MAKE HASTE WITH THOSE INFORMATION. 
I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU SOONEST. 
BESIDES, I WILL BE OBLIGED IF YOU CAN GIVE ME A CALL FOR MORE
CONFIDENTIALITY TODAY ON MY PRIVATE LINE : +27 83 666 9226
WITH THE KINDEST REGARDS,
<p>
Mr. DZ.

<h3>Mr. RHA&#39;s Reply</h3>
<p>
Mr. DZ
<p>
I have good news that may aid the conduction of our most privelege and
private affairs of financial matters. I&#39;m planning a trip to Johannesburg.
With the recent death of my dog Bleki, I have been quite lonely. 
So I have made plans to visit my foster child (yes I have a foster 
child in South Africa, I adopted him two years ago and his name was 
Gabe Mukababe). I have little doubt the smile of his face will warm 
my heart.
<p>
Yours in superiority
<br>
Mr. RHA.
<p>

<p>
<h3>Mr. DZ&#39;s Reply</h3>
<p>
DEAR RHA,
<p>
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE PROSPECT OF THIS DEAL IS BEING DELAYED LONGER
THAN NECESSARY, AND I AM BEGINNING TO FIND IT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND 
YOUR POSITION AND INTEREST IN FULL. LIKE I WELL SAID, THE ISSUE OF 
PARTAKING IN THIS DEAL MUST NOT BE RE-OVEREMPHASISED, IN THAT THE 
PARTICIPATION IS OUT OF SELF WILLINGNESS. RIGHT FROM THE VERY FIRST 
TIME I SENT YOU MY REQUEST TO MAKE ALLIANCES WITH YOU IN THIS DEAL,
IT WAS STATED VERY CLEAR WHAT NECESSARY INFORMATION YOU ARE REQUIRED 
TO BRING TO EFFECT THE TRANSFER OF THE MONEY INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. BUT 
IT&#39;S GOOD THAT YOU WILL BE COMING HERE SOON AND FINISH OUR TRANSACTION.
REGARDS
<p>
Mr. DZ.

<h3>Mr. RHA&#39;s Reply</h3>
<p>
Dear Mr. DZ,
<p>
These past few days have suredly been very hard for me. 
It&#39;s difficult to make my thoughts stay to focus on one thing.
I wish to focus them on our most urgent and private matters of business. 
You know, I used to walk the beaches with my deceased dog Bleki.
O yeah, I must ask of you a kindness favor when I visit South Africa.
Your English is most proper good. And my foster son Mukababe knows 
almost no English at all. 
<p>
When I visit him I would most prefer to speak with him in a
language we can understand each other. 
But instead I am in fear we will demand a translator. 
Would you my friend avail your self to accompany me on
this visit and serve me as kind translator?
I&#39;m not sure what language Mukababe speaks, he has sent me tape recorded
greetings but they just sound like clicking noises to me together with the
sound of a dying giraffe on the background. Except when the woman&#39;s voice
speaks English and French and tells me he is healthy and strong and
learning in school. I think she is the voice of a nun that teaches
him.  
<p>
In any of the event you and I shall soon meet face in front of face to
conduct our intimate affairs.
<p>
Yours circumspectly,
<p>
Mr. RHA.
<p>
Ps. Would you be kind taking us to your local zoo? 
Mukababe and me would very much appreciate that.
<p>
