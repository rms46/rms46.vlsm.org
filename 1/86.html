	<br>MEMO: about "method" in the sense in which social philosophers characteristically employ the term - the sense in which Durkheim used it in his <i>Rules of Social Method</i> [p. viii].

<hr>
<li>	Interpretative sociologist are "<i>strong on action, but weak
	on structure</i>". On the other hand, fuctionalist and structural
	approaches, while "<i>strong on structure</i>", has been 
	"<i>weak on action </i>" 
	[p. 4].
<li>	Conclusion [pp. 163-170]:
<hr>	
<ul>
<li>	The social world, unlike the world of nature, has to be grasped as 
	a skilled accomplishment of active human subjects; the constition
	of this world as "<i>meaningful</i>", "<i>accountable</i>",
	or "<i>intelligible</i>" depends upon language, regarded, however,
	not simply as a system of signs or symbols but as a medium of
	practical activity; the social scientist of necessity draws upon
	the same sorts of skills as those whose conduct he or she seeks
	to analyse in order to describe it; generating description of
	social conduct depends upon hermeneutic task of penetrating the
	frames of meaning which lay actors themselves draw upon in
	constituting ans reconstituting the social world.
<hr>
<li>	Sociology is not concerned with a "<i>pre-given</i>" universe of
	objects, but with one which is constituted or produced by the active
	doings of subjects.
<li>	The production and reproduction of society this has to be treaded
	as a skilled performance on the part of its members.
<hr>
<li>	The realm of human agency is bounded. Human beings produce society,
	but they do so as historically located actors, and not under conditions
	of their own choosing.
<li>	(The duality of structure:) Stucture must not be conceptualized 
	as simply placing constraints upon human agency, but enabling.
<li>	Processes of structuration involve an interplay of meanings, norms,
	and power.
<hr>
<li>	The sociological observer cannot make social life available as
	a "<i>phenomenon</i>" for observation independently of drawing 
	upon her/his knowledge of it as a resource whereby it is constituted
	as a "<i>topic for investigation</i>".
<li>	Immersion in a form of life is the necessary and only means whereby
	an observer is able to generate such characterizations.
<li>	Sociological concepts this obey a double hermeneutic
<ul>
<li>	The hermeneutic explication and mediation of divergent forms of life
	within descriptive metalanguages of social science
<li>	Explication of the production and reproduction of society as the
	accomplished outcome of human agency.
