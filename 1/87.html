	<br>MEMO: Discussion and Suggestion: why most IS academic research today lacks relevance to practive.

<br>	Professionals tend to read articles that (p. 5):
	are shorter;
	use more exhibits;
	use everyday language, rather than esoteric or stilted language;
	have less discussion of a study&39;s methods;
	have more contextual description;
	have more prescriptions;
	(omit on article&#39;s rigor).
