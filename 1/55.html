<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
        This paper discusses UNINET, a proposed inter-University 
	computer network in Indonesia. The network is intended to 
	provide network service and access mainly for educators and 
	researches in the computer field, and for administrators of 
	state universities/ institutes. Combining computer technology
	telecommunication facilities, it is a logical network 
	utilizing the services of several physical networks.
	Nodes can be in the form of local-area networks (LAN&#39;s) 
	and single-host nodes. The network&#39;s architecture and 
	functions are discussed and the implementation plans briefly 
	laid out.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
        The dependency of modern man upon the computer is getting 
	increasingly irrevocable. Computer technology, both hardware 
	and software, is expanding and improving faster than most of 
	us can keep pace. Much of our work is done by computers, 
	from keeping track of bank accounts, process control in 
	industry to adjusting the fuel mixture in automobile 
	carburetors. Some major industries, such as banking, process 
	such vast volumes of data that their task of information 
	management would be impossible without computers. On
	university campuses, the realization that numerical tasks 
	can not be completed without computers is deeply rooted. 
	The control of library facilities, maintenance of student 
	record and management of entrance examinations are but a 
	few of the potential computer applications in these environments.
<p>
        This paper focuses on one particular facet of computer 
	technology - that of computer networking between university 
	environments. The term "computer network" is used to include 
	any hardware/software entity that may serve to link computer 
	systems in an orderly manner so as to establish inter-computer
	communications. The network only concern the exchange of 
	information between systems, and not the internal functioning of 
	each individual system. This information transfer is performed 
	by means of physical media for systems interconnection.
<p>
        The Next sections describe the proposed network architecture 
	and its underlying design philosophy, the institutional frame 
	work and a brief discussion of the technical aspects. For 
	practical purposes, the term "inter-university computer network" 
	is abbreviated to UNINET in this paper. However, this is by no
	means the official name by which the network will actually be 
	known.

<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
<p>
        UNINET is intended to provide educators and researchers 
	in the computer field with resource sharing and communication 
	capabilities. Administrators will benefit from the remote 
	data access feature which supports integrated processing 
	activities among various organizations.
<p>
        The design of the network is guided by three main principles 
<ol type="a">
<li>	UNINET is to be available first to any state university/ institute 
	and the Ministry of Education and Culture. To promoted the 
	cooperation in computer-oriented education and research, and 
	administrative data processing.
<li>	Second, it is also to be available to other interested 
	post-secondary educational institution active in the computer 
	field, and to any industrial and government organization in 
	Indonesia which is engaged in computer-related education and 
	research, and special-purpose databases.
<li>	Third, it should be capable of utilizing the various existing 
	(and planned) physical communication facilities in order to 
	attain the best (i.e. the most economical) network configuration.
</ol>

<h2>Network Architecture</h2>
<p>
        By serving the user community with network facilities and access, 
	UNINET will enable institution to participate trough a network 
	interface. It is a logical network utilizing the services of 
	various physical networks. Figure I shows UNINET&#39;s  
	logical architecture. Participating nodes will consist of 
	local-area-networks(LAN&#39;s) and single-host systems. This 
	implies that UNINET will not accommodate direct terminal hookups. 
	Instead, nodes are required to possess a certain level of 
	intelligence, which can be implemented through "gateways", if the 
	node is itself a network or, in the case of single-host nodes,
	through a network interface. Practically this gateways are similar 
	to the network interfaces, in that they both must interface the 
	local communication characteristics to the attributes of the 
	physical network (for example: X.25 ) used by UNINET. They can 
	thus both be based on the same microcomputer, but configured 
	(and programmed) differently.

<p>
        A Layered architecture is proposed to achieve systems modularity 
	and improve compatibility. The proliferation of machines and 
	communication protocols have made it necessary to maintain and 
	architecture versatile enough interface properly with various 
	systems. The open systems Interconnection scheme [ISO 79] lends 
	itself nicely into this requirement. Although there my be some 
	disadvantages to be gained far outweigh the problems.
<p>
	The LAN&#39;s will conceivably be a collection of Ethernet 
	systems [MeBo76], high-speed fiber-optics systems such as 
	described for example in [CRKL81], and other LAN architecture.
<p>
        Four types of nodes will exist, categorized by the level of 
	services rendered. The first is the common user (CU) node, 
	which pertains to nodes whose participation in the network 
	mainly consists of the exchange of mail message and the 
	submittal of computing jobs to other (remote) nodes (The various
	functions that UNINET will serve are discussed later). The 
	second is the regional service center (RCS) node, which is 
	capable of performing network services for CU&#39;s in 
	its "region" in addition to being a user itself. An RSC is 
	planned to have more computing power than the CU&#39;s in its 
	(geographic) region. At the national level UNINET will have 
	four national service centers (NSC&#39; s), each with ample 
	computing power to support requests originating from any RSC or CU.
	These four NSC&#39;s will be located in Bandung, Jakarta,
	Yogyakarta and Surabaya. The fourth type of node is the 
	special service centers (SSC&#39; s).These nodes will
	render support to the network in the form of access to 
	specialized databases, bibliographic services, cartographic 
	data accesses, etc. It is also conceivable to have a powerful 
	number cruncher as an SSC.

<h2>Institutional Framework</h2>
<p>
        The planning and development activities of UNINET will be 
	sponsored by and conducted under the auspices of the Directorate 
	General of Higher Education, Department of Education and Culture. 
	For main tasks are identified, namely the overall management of 
	the project, policy support, organizational  support and technical 
	support. The last three tasks tackle the details of the 
	development process while the first task includes cooperation 
	with other organizations  outside the Department.

<h2>Network Functions</h2>
<p>
        A user interfacing with a computer network may want to 
	perform any combination of the usual network functions, namely:
<ul>
<li>	Send/receive electronic mail 
<li>	Transfer files Submit a batch-job 
	to a remote computer Interactively logon a remote system
<li>	Perform distributed processing 
<li>	Access a distributed database
</ul>
	Of these functions, the first three constitute the most favorable 
	candidates for initial implementation in UNINET. They are 
	relatively easy to implement, and will develop a level of 
	familiarity among the user community which in turn will promote 
	a conducive climate for further cooperation.
<p>
        In developed countries, electronic mail is widely use for communication among individuals in a
given organization and more recently, among peers belonging to different organizations. In the past few
years a number of such mail systems became operational, among others MAILNET [HeLL82] it uses a star
topology with dial-up polling during reduced-rate periods (I .e night time). A user can create, send, and
receive messages and documents on his/her own local system even if the correspondent is a user of a totally
different system. A computer located at the hub of the network performs all of the functions a post-office
clerk, viz. Dealing with different envelope formats, sorting of letters, making decisions about how to
deliver the letter, and how respond to a variety of errors. In addition to this, MAILNET&#39; s electronic
clerk makes the necessary copies of messages sent to multiple recipients.
<p>
        The proposed initial phase for UNINET is an electronic mail system very much like MAILNET. While
waiting for s public packet switching network for Indonesia, dial-up facilities can be utilized, albeit at
a quite high cost. A computer In Jakarta or Bandung can be used as the hub where post master functions are
implemented. Development  of the necessary software will be a very valuable experience in implementing
subsequent phases of the network. Files can be transferred and handled by the mail system just like
ordinary messages, although size limitations need to be implemented. Batch jobs specified with the required
control statements can be submitted to the queue handler at remote site, providing that necessary
permissions (and accounting information) are secured beforehand. In this manner files and batch jobs are
processed similar to common mail messages. The different being that files are sent to the files handler at
the target computer, and the batch jobs are sent with the queue handler as the recipient.

<h2>Implementation Plans</h2>
<p>
        Rather than tackling the physical problems of network development, it is proposed to concentrate on
the higher layer protocol and software problems. Experience gained in the initial stage will not only
improve the confidence of the developers, but more importantly, promote a positive attitude towards
resource sharing among universities / institutes, and possibly other organizations as well. It is
conceivable to have an electronic mail system among the four NSC&#39; s by the end of the first year. It is
hope that may that time a working packet switching network exists, so that gateway and interface units can
be designed and tested. This will bring us well into the third year of implementation, by which time LAN&#39; s
will be implemented at some of the nodes. The fourth and final year of the five-year plan can then be
dedicated to the development of the other network functions.
