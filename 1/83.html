<h1>The Memo Page of Hypotheses</h1>
Karl "Chuck B." Freiherr von Manteuffel

<ul>
<li>	Paul K. Feyerabend (1976):
<br>	[...This result can be generalised...] Any hypothesis, however
	implausible, can widen our horizon. It has not led to a better
	understanding of science and it is even a hindrance to such
	a better understanding because of its habit of beclouding
	facts with semons and moralizing phrases (p. 136).
<li>	Paul K. Feyerabend (1978):
<br>	We may use hypothesis that contradict well confirmed
	theories and/or well-established experimental results.
	We may advance science by proceeding counterinductively
	[FEYERABEND78, p. 5].
<li>	Paul F. Lazarsfeld (1956):
<br>	You never test hypotheses! First you run everything against
	everything. Then find out what the relationships are to the
	0.05 level. Then you write a hypothesis for a relationship
	and say you tested it. And that's how Lazarsfeld said to do it
	[GLASER98, p. 23].
<li>	Robert I. Sutton and Anat Rafaeli (1992):
<br>	When your hypotheses aren't confirmed, you don't admit it, you
	change the hypotheses in your introductions with to fit the data.
	[...] Of course, we always write our hypotheses after we get
	our results. It is more efficient that way!
	[FROSTSTABLEIN92, p. 122].
