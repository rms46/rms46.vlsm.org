	<br>MEMO: Paul, why don&#39;t you write down all your strange idea? -- Imre Lakatos

<li>	<b>[pp. 5 - 8]</b>
<br>	Science is an essentially anarchic enterprise: theoretical
	anarchism is more humanitarian and more likely to encourage
	progress that its law-and-order alternatives.
<li>	This is shown both by an examination of historical episodes
	and by an abstract analysis of the relation between idea and action.
	The only principle that does not inhibit progress is
	<b>ANYTHING GOES</b>.
<li>	For example, we may use hypothesis that contradict well confirmed
	theories and/or well-established experimental results.
	We may advance science by proceeding counterinductively.
