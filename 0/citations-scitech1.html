	<br>MEMO: Researcher in developin countries find that some of the most frustating problems they face are in the library, not the laboratory.

<br>	There is no question in my mind that there is some inherent
	prejudice in the minds of some referees in the West about
	authors from the Third World countries -- Rao.

<li>	Someone told me that each equation I included in the book
	would halve the sales.
<li>	A good theory satisfies two requirements (p. 9):
	it must accurately describe a large class of observations on
	the basis of a model that contains only a few arbitrary elements,
	it must make definite prediction about the results of future 
	observations.
<li>	any physical theory is always provisional, in the sense that it
	is only a hypothesis, you can never prove it. No matter how many 
	times the results of experiments agree with some theory, 
	you can never be sure that the next time the result will not
	contradict the theory (p. 10).
<li>	But, in order to get married, I needed a job, and in order
	to get a job, I needed a Ph.D (p.  49).
<li>	4 force categories: gravitational, electomagnetic, weak nuclear,
	strong nuclear (p. 70).

	<br>MEMO: Where does all reviewer lords come from?

<br>	[...] the fact that roughly midway between the time Compton
	deliver his quantum scattering paper at the meeting of the
	American Physical Society on <b>December 1 or 2, 1922</b>, and the
	time he sent it to <i>The Physical Review</i> for publication
	on <b>December 13, 1992</b>, he also sent his total internal reflection
	paper to <i>The Philosophical Magazine</i> for publication on
	<b>December 6, 1922</b> (p. 632).
<br>	[Comments] Gee, no web, no email, though it was then faster
	than today (990225) !
