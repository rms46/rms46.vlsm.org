<h1>Ahbeng's Declaration of INDEPENDENCE</h1>
<h2>Tan Ah Beng, N21: Choa Chu Kang Pty. Ltd.</h2>
<h3>In-ternet, July 4, 1998:</h3>
<p>
	The unanimous Declaration of the <b>IN</b>donesian <b>DE</b>sperate 
	<b>PEN</b>ding <b>D</b>omain <b>ENC</b>umbranc<b>E</b>,
</p><p>
	When in the Internet event, it becomes necessary for one Top Level 
	Domain (TLD) administrator to resolve problems of the others, and 
	to assume among the power of the TLD-ID;
	it requires a decent opinion that should be declared for an 
	administration separation. We hold this RFC-1591.
	truth to be self-evident, that all human are created equal to have 
	right for an Internet domain name. That to secure these rights,
	prudence, indeed, while evils are sufferable; but when a long 
	train of abuses, it is the right and duty to abolish the dishonest 
	shameless brainless <i>dodols</i> as well as <i>tijumbous</i>.
</p><p>
	As from July 27, 1996, the TLD-ID administrative contact 
	has been on-leave. Therefore, the 
	University of Indonesia
	(<b>UofI</b>) was asked to propose a new TLD-ID framework. 
	The preliminary estimation for a new TLD-ID settlement was 
	<i>a couple of months</i>, whereas the "<i>suggested deadline</i>" 
	was on January 1, 1997. However, nothing happened then, and therefore
	it was agreed an <i>all new ultimate</i> deadline on 
	August 17, 1997, i.e. the Indonesian 52<sup>nd</sup> Independence Day.
	Unexpected, prior to that deadline, the UofI expressed their 
	intention to pullout from the domain maintenance activity, 
	starting on September 30, 1997. Although the UofI's official 
	reason to pullout is <i>"busy with internal affairs"</i>; 
	apparently something else had happened.
</p><p>
	Until September 30, 1997 morning, everything was uncertain.
	Around noon, Dr. Budi Rahardjo volunteered himself to take care 
	of the domain registration administration. His email became the appendix G
	of Gagasan 30 September 1997/PDTT-ID.
	Since September 30, 1997, therefore, the TLD-ID was in 
	<i>status-quo</i>.
	However, only 4 months after, somehow Dr. Budi Rahardjo 
	had <i>enough</i> with all those 
	<i><b>external interventions</b></i>.
	Since the beginning of 1998, therefore, he declared 
	<b>IDNIC-DUO</b> as an independent 
	entity that is free of any external influence.
</p><p>
	On July 4, 1998, therefore, these following have been 
	suggested:
</p><ol>
<li>	<b>IDNIC Information Pages</b>
<p>
	The IDNIC's Informational WebPages
	should be reengineered, as the current one is a little bit 
	ambiguous. IANA's transitional 
	web-page style could be considered as a model.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>	<b>IDNIC and IDNIC-PM's (Project Manager) Position and 
	Commitment</b>
<p>
	To avoid equivocality -- IDNIC as well as the IDNIC-PM -- 
	should make a clear statement regarding its position and 
	commitment. This includes -- but not limited to -- IDNIC's 
	relation with other entities, a rough framework, timeframe, 
	DNS stability, fairness, equal opportunity, etc.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>	<b>The TLD-ID Administrative Contact Commitment</b>
<p>
	Based on 
	<a href="http://rms46.vlsm.org/1/23.html" target="_top">Gagasan 30 September 1997</a>
	the current 
	TLD-ID
	administrative contact agrees to be in-charge unless this 
	following has occurred:
</p><ul>
<li>	the <b>maximum non-negotiable</b> deadline would be February 6, 2003.
</li><li>	a stalemate / disagreement with the IDNIC-PM
</li><li>	a new procedure has been settled, and a new TLD-ID 
	administrative contact has been suggested 
</li><li>	the IDNIC-PM fails to issue a <b><i>monthly</i></b> public notice 
	for four consecutive months or for a total of eight times
</li></ul>
<p>
	However, it became very obvious on July 27, 1998, that 
	no significant progress was made, and therefore RMS46
	had decided to resign.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>	<b>Domain Stability</b>
<p>
	IDNIC should propose an integrated DNS system procedure 
	that includes - but not limited to - primaries and 
	secondaries allocation.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>	<b>New Feedback and Operational Mechanisms</b>
<p>
	As the current IDNIC mailing list is not effective, new 
	mechanisms should be considered.
