Nominations for the open IESG positions

The 1995 Nominating Committee submitted the following nominations for
confirmation by the IAB:

Operations AD (2 yr term) Scott Bradner

Transport AD (2 yr term) Allison Mankin

Network Management AD (2 yr term) Deirdre Kostick

Application AD (1 yr term) John Klensin

Application AD (2 yr term) Harald Alvestrand

Internet AD (1 yr term) Sue Thompson

Internet AD (2 yr term) Frank Kastenholz

The IAB has confirmed these nominations, which will be effective Thursday
April 6, after the end of the IETF open plenary.

I would like to thank the new IESG members who volunteered for nomination or
renomination, those whose turn of service terminate on April 6, and indeed
also John Curran and the members of the nominating committee, who did a
brilliant job. All our process relies on the work of volunteers, and I am
glad
that we could find such a brilliant set of personnalities to volunteer for
those demanding positions.
