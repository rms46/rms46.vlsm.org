IAB/IESG Nominations Committee



The following will be serving as the 1993 IAB/IESG Nominations Committee:

Jack Brown                              jbrown@huachuca-emh8.army.mil
Jeff Case, Chair                        ietfnom@cs.utk.edu
Peter S. Ford                           peter@goshawk.lanl.gov
Erik Huizer, IESG Liasion, Ex-officio   huizer@surfnet.nl
Geoff Huston, ISOC Liasion, Ex-officio  G.Huston@aarnet.edu.au
Steve Kent                              kent@bbn.com
Barry Leiner, IAB Liasion, Ex-officio   leiner@nsipo.nasa.gov
Paul Mockapetris                        pvm@DARPA.MIL
Craig Partridge                         craig@aland.bbn.com
Jon Postel, IRSG Liasion, Ex-officio    postel@isi.edu
Jim Romaguera                           romaguera@cosine-mhs.switch.ch
Claudio Topolcic                        topolcic@CNRI.Reston.VA.US

Alternates (in case one or more of the 7 are unable to serve)

Steve Waldbusser, 1st alternate         sw0l+@andrew.cmu.edu
Bill Norton, 2nd alternate              wbn@merit.edu
Bill Manning, 3rd alternate             bmanning@rice.edu


The random selection was performed as follows:

I took a stack of identical business cards and printed the name of a volunteer
on each.  The names were then placed in a basket, and shuffled well.  Cards
with names were then drawn by Dr. David Eubanks, President, Johnson
Bible College.  He was selected because he is one of the most honest men I
know, has an unblemished reputation, has no vested interest in the outcome,
and was gracious enough to humor my request.  The first seven selected will
staff the committee, and the eighth, ninth, and tenth were identified at the
1st, 2nd, and 3rd alternates, respectively.

The names were checked to see that they meet the selection criteria of
attendance at two or more IETF plenaries, and all do.

We will be getting started to work almost immediately.  While our deliberations
will be confidential, we will be providing status reports from time-to-time
to keep you informed.  Vint Cerf will soon be posting a message that summarizes
the jobs to be filled.

Finally, I'd like to thank all of those who volunteered for offering to serve.
I hope you will do so again the next time volunteers are sought.
This chair appreciated it and I'm sure the next one will too.

regards,
