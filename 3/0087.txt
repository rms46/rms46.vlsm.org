(Letter re. who owns the address space)

It was argued that the letter should avoid statements of "ownership" of the
address space.  Instead, have the ISOC state that they endorse a particular
management plan for the address space, and don't deal with issues of
abandonment at all.  Also, the word "custodian" might be better than "owner."

Really, we want the IANA to control the address space, which then allocates
them according to guidance from the IAB and the IETF.  The issue is who has
the ultimate responsibility when someone does not like what the IANA does.

A proposal is to give ownership to ISOC at the same time that it delegates
addresses, thus removing any bottlenecks.  However, this still does not
answer the question of who owns and controls the reserve space.

 - prepare 1466++. Should we send a letter to the IEPG? Should there be a
   recommendation of the IAB? Should there be a public review?

In fact, all this "what should the registry do" questions beg for one answer,
i.e. a clear revision of 1466. We need to have written rules. We also need
these rules to be well accepted, which implies public review, last call and
all this sort of things.

David,

You have a choice of three possibilities:

1) consider that 1466 fully applies as long as the revision is not published,

2) continue current practice, which involves 1466, 1597, 1626, IAB and IANA
   statements and a lot of case by case discussions,

3) ask "someone in charge" (e.g. IANA) to publish an interim amendment to
   1466, pending its revision.

My point is that the interim period should really be as short as possible.
Whether (1), (2) or (3) is the right interim solution could well be discussed
here.

     Mark Kosters and Kim Hubbard attended the NANOG meeting in Ann Arbor,
     Michigan on June 22-23, 1995.  Mark gave a presentation on the status
     of the InterNIC and the draft IP allocation practices that has been
     created in lieu of the general ip allocation document effort,
     rfc1466bis. RFC1466bis was broken into sections and assigned at RIPE
     in Jan 1995. Both the APNIC and InterNIC portions where completed. The
     RIPE section has not yet been completed. Kim Hubbard has agreed to
     complete the unfinished work in the RIPE section and pull the document
     together for review.
     Mark Kosters attended INET95 to give a presentation on the status of
     the InterNIC.

           INTERNET REGISTRY IP ALLOCATION GUIDELINES
           <draft-hubbard-registry-guidelines-01> for consideration as
           a Best Current Practices RFC.

    The IESG gave tentative approval of INTERNET REGISTRY IP ALLOCATION
    GUIDELINES <draft-hubbard-registry-guidelines-05.txt> pending the
    conposition of text for the IESG comment which will include a
    sunset clause (point in future when document will reviewed. Once
    the IESG note is written, and each of the dissenters convey their
    acceptance, Steve will send announcement

    There was some discussion on Reconsidering RFC2050 (INTERNET REGISTRY IP
    ALLOCATION GUIDELINES. When published, an IESG note was included which
    stated that this document would  be reconsidered in a year. The IESG
    consensus was that it was premature to do that at this point due to the
    significant ammount of activity in the US goverment in this area and in
    the address registeries - the effect of these activties will become
    more apparent in a few months. A target of March 1, 1998 was mentioned,
    but it was noted that a response to the email query should be made
    relatively soon.

    The IESG agreed to work on the proper wording of the response via email.
    As Scott received the initial query, he will send the response. May also
    copy the IETF list as well.
