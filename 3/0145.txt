IAB Chair -- 14 February 1997 -- IETF
-------------------------------------

IETF,

I wish to thank Geoff Huston for the work of the Nominating Committee in
selecting new IAB members. The four outgoing members are:

        J Allard                          
        Elise Gerich
        Yakov Rekhter                             
        Chris Weider

I'd like specifically to thank Elise for her contributions to
operational issues the IAB has dealt with, Chris for his contributions
towards internationalization, and Yakov for his contributions on     
IP addressing and routing issues. 

Thanks are also due to Allison Mankin, who is leaving the the
IESG, for being an effective liaison from the IESG to the IAB.

The new IAB elects its chair annually upon taking office.
The new IAB, effective the evening of April 10, 1997, will be:
