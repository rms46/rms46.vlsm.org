1 Abstract


   IP unicast address allocation and management are essential
   operational functions for the Internet. The exact policies for IP
   unicast address allocation and management continue to be the subject
   of many discussions.  Such discussions cannot be pursued in a vacuum
   - the participants must understand the technical issues and
   implications associated with various address allocation and
   management policies.

   The purpose of this document is to articulate certain relevant
   fundamental technical issues which must be considered in formulating
   unicast address allocation and management policies for the Internet.
   The major focus of this document is on one possible policy, the
   concept of "address ownership," and the technical implications of
   this concept for the Internet.

2 Address allocation and management policies


   IP address allocation and management policy is a fairly complex,
   multifaceted issue. It covers a broad range of issues, such as who
   formulates the policies, who executes the policies, what are the
   roles of various registries, what are the roles of various
   organizations (e.g. ISOC, IAB, IESG, IETF, IEPG, various government
   bodies, etc.), the participation of end users in requesting
   addresses, and so on.

   Support for "address ownership" is one possible address allocation
   and management policy. Supporting "address ownership" means that once
   an address prefix is allocated or assigned to an organization, the
   organization may always use these addresses.  This implies that the
   organization will never need to change addresses (renumber), even if
   the organization changes it's topological interconnection to the
   Internet.

   Some parties have asserted that the Internet assumes the concept of
   address ownership already.  At the same time the fact remains that
   the concept of address ownership has never been explicit - the words
   that have been used have been "assignment," "allocation," and
   "delegation".  One should also note that even if the current
   allocation procedures may be viewed as consistent with "address
   ownership," this does not mean that address ownership is, in fact,
   the current policy.

   Address allocation and management and the ability of the Internet
   routing system to scale are not independent - only certain address
   allocation and management policies yield scalable routing.  Since
   address ownership is a significant factor in such policies, we need
   to understand its implications on the scalability of the Internet
   routing system.


3 On the relationship between addressing and routing


   Syntactically, the set of IPv4 unicast addresses is the (finite) set
   of integers in the range 0x01000000 - 0xdfffffff.  The notable
   semantics of an IP unicast address is its ability to gain access to
   the Internet routing service and thereby exchange data with the
   remainder of the Internet.  IP addresses are used for Network Layer
   (IP) routing, thus an IP address is the sole piece of information
   about the node that is injected into the routing system.  In other
   words, it is the reachability of an IP address that gives it an
   intrinsic value - without reachability the address is worthless.

   The above implies that it is the service environment (the Internet)
   and its continued operation, including its routing system, which
   provides an IP address with its intrinsic value, rather than the
   inverse.  Consequently, if the Internet routing system ceases to be
   operational, the service disappears, and the addresses cease to have

   any functional value. At this point, in the context of the Internet,
   all address allocation and management policies, including "address
   ownership," are rendered meaningless.


4 Address ownership and its implication on hierarchical routing


   Hierarchical routing [Kleinrock 77] is used in the Internet as the
   primary mechanism to contain the growth of routing information -
   without hierarchical routing the Internet routing system would
   already have collapsed.  Further, hierarchical routing is the only
   known mechanism for scaling routing to the current size of the
   Internet.

   Hierarchical routing places certain constraints on address allocation
   and management policies.  Specifically, hierarchical routing assumes
   that (a) addresses have to be unique within an internet if they are
   to have global reachability, and (b) addresses need to reflect the
   topology of the network.  Consequently, to preserve hierarchical
   routing as the topology changes, an entity's address may be required
   to change - this process is known as "renumbering."

   It should be noted that there are today a considerable number of
   exceptions in the routing system.  Such exceptions are prefixes that
   have been injected that do not reflect the topology of the network.
   Further, because the topology of the network is not strictly
   hierarchical, there are a large number of exceptions which will have
   to be injected into the routing system in the future, in addition to
   those exceptions which currently exist.  Each such exception which is
   added to the routing system has a deleterious effect on the
   scalability of the routing system.  The number of exceptions which
   can be tolerated is dependent on the exact technology which is used
   to support routing.  Unbridled injection of such exceptions will
   certainly cause the routing system to collapse.  Similarly, if the
   sustained rate of injection of exceptions exceeds the rate at which
   routing technology scales, the routing system is doomed.

   By definition, address ownership assumes that addresses, once
   assigned, do not change, and therefore no renumbering can take place.
   By definition, hierarchical routing assumes that addresses reflect
   network topology.  Therefore, the only way to accommodate both
   address ownership and hierarchical routing for everyone is to assume
   that the topology (or at least certain pieces of it) will be
   permanently fixed. In circumstances where the topology can change
   arbitrarily, we can accommodate one, but not both - we can either
   have address ownership, in combination with a non-routable (and
   therefore non-functional) Internet, or we can have a routable
   Internet, but without address ownership. In the latter case the
   concept of "address ownership" is being superseded by a policy of
   "address leasing".

   An "address leasing" policy means that an organization acquires its
   addresses on a "lease" basis. After the lease expires, or if the

   organization moves, the organization may either renew the lease (in
   which case the addresses stay the same), or terminate the old lease
   and establish a new lease (in which case the addresses change).  The
   "leasing" policy must be hierarchical as well, so that addresses may
   be "sub-let" to other organizations.  The implication here is that
   the expiration of a single lease may have effects on organizations
   which have recursively sub-let a portion of the address space from
   the main lease.


5 Recommendations


   This document proposes that all requests for address assignment and
   allocation which are fulfilled by various registries be under the
   policy of address leasing.  Consequently, such assignments and
   allocations should explicitly include (among other things) the
   duration of the lease, and conditions under which the lease could be
   renewed or terminated.  Existing address assignments and allocations
   are outside the scope of this document.

   Observe that the goal of hierarchical routing in the Internet is not
   to reduce the total amount of routing information in the Internet to
   the theoretically possible minimum, but just to contain the volume of
   routing information within the limits of technology,
   price/performance, and human factors.  Therefore, organizations which
   could provide reachability to a sufficiently large fraction of the
   total destinations in the Internet and could express such
   reachability through a single IP address prefix could expect that a
   route with this prefix will be maintained throughout the default-free
   part of the Internet routing system.

   For all other organizations, the reachability information they inject
   into the Internet routing system would be subject to hierarchical
   aggregation.  Consequently, when such an organization changes its
   topological attachment to the Internet, but wishes to preserve
   Internet-wide IP connectivity, the organization eventually needs to
   renumber to eliminate any exceptional prefixes that they would
   otherwise inject into the Internet routing system.  This applies both
   to the case where the organization takes its addresses out of its
   direct provider's block and the organization changes its direct
   provider, and to the case where the organization takes its addresses
   out of its indirect provider's block, and the organization changes
   its indirect provider.

   If the organization doesn't require Internet-wide IP connectivity,
   then renumbering can be avoided. In this case the organization may
   still maintain limited IP connectivity (e.g. with all the subscribers
   of its direct provider) by limiting the scope of its routing
   exception to its direct provider.

   Since renumbering is not cost-free, an organization, when presented
   with a choice of renumbering vs. limited IP connectivity, needs to
   carefully analyze its own requirements and compare the tradeoffs

   associated with each alternative.

   Organizations should be strongly encouraged to deploy tools that
   facilitate renumbering (e.g. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol [RFC
   1541]). Use of the DNS (rather than /etc/hosts) should be strongly
   encouraged.


6 Conclusions


   Any address allocation and management policy for IP addresses used
   for the Internet connectivity must take into account its impact on
   the scalability of the Internet routing system.

   Among all of the possible address allocation and management policies
   only the ones that yield scalable routing system are feasible - all
   other policies are self-destructive in nature, as they lead to a
   collapse of the Internet routing system, and thereby to the collapse
   of the Internet.

   Within the context of hierarchical routing, address allocation and
   management policies that assume unrestricted address ownership have
   an extremely negative impact on the scalability of the Internet
   routing system - such policies are almost certain to exhaust the
   scalability of the Internet routing system well before we even
   approach the exhaustion of the IPv4 address space and certainly well
   before we will be able to make moderate use of the IPv6 address
   space.

   With the current technology or any near-term foreseeable technology,
   given the Internet's growth rate, the notion that everyone should be
   able to own address space and receive routing services, regardless of
   where they connect to the Internet, is technically infeasible.

   Therefore, this document recommends that any address allocation and
   management policy should explicitly dispel the notion of "address
   ownership" and use the policy of "address leasing" instead.
