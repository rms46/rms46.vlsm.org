Abel Weinrib has indicated his desire to step down as IRTF and IRSG
Chair. It falls to the IAB to appoint his successor, in accordance
with RFC 1601 and RFC 2014. The IAB is considering several
candidates, but solicits further nominations or self-nominations.
These should be addressed IN CONFIDENCE to me,

I would like to take this opportunity to thank Abel for his
efforts over the last several years.
