SIP & IPAE groups to merge and shuffle chairs 


With Christian Huitema's election as IAB chair and the extra workload that
that entails, he has decided to resign as co-chair of the SIP Working Group.
With the approval of the Internet Area ADs, Bob Hinden will be taking his
place as co-chair (with Steve Deering) of the SIP group.

This also seems an appropriate time to terminate the separate IPAE
Working Group, chaired by Dave Crocker, and have its work taken over by
the SIP group, since IPAE has evolved into being the SIP transition and
implementation group. This will require a modification of the SIP WG
charter, which will be submitted to the IESG for approval.
