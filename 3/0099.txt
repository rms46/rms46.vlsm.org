Policy Statement on Address Space Allocations

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Regional Internet Registries (APNIC, InterNIC, RIPE NCC) refer
organizations requesting IP address space to their Internet service
providers (ISPs).  This is done for various reasons, the main reason
being that IP addresses need to be assigned heirarchically to allow
aggregation of routing information (CIDR).  Customers are warned of
possible routing restrictions if addresses are not received from an
ISP's CIDR block.  Since some ISPs are presently restricting the length
of prefixes they route, it is even more important for end users to
receive IP addresses from their Internet service provider. 

Regional Internet registries have no control over the routing policies
of any ISP.  The IANA has instructed the Internet registries not to
assign IP addresses based on any ISP's particular routing policy, rather
on specific criteria including utilization efficiency.  An organization
will be assigned the number of IP addresses it can justify.  If this
number is not fully routable, that is an issue that should be taken up
with the ISP(s) concerned. 

Regional Internet Registries inform ISPs about allocation and assignment
policies.  This enables ISPs to take these policies into account when
setting their routing policies.
