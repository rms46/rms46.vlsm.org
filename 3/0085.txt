IAB Chair -- 24 March 1994 -- IETF
----------------------------------

Nominations for Open IESG Slots


Fellow Internauts,

You have all seen on this list the announce of nominations for IESG positions
from the nomination committee. These nominations have now been approved by
the IAB, and are now official:

Applications AD: Erik Huizer

Internet AD: Claudio Topolcic

Security AD: Jeff Schiller

User Services AD: Joyce Reynolds

Routing AD: Joel Halpern

I would like to present my best wishes to the new and continuing IESG
members. I would also like to thank the outgoing IESG members, Dave Crocker,
Steve Crocker and Bob Hinden, for all the work they did for the community. I
am sure that they will continue to contribute to the constant progress of the
Internet.

You may also have noticed that Phil Gross has been nominated for an IAB
position. This does indeed imply that Phil, after chairing the IETF from 1987
to 1994, has decided to step down. That was certainly a tough job - it is
under Phil's leadership that the IETF grew to its present size! I think that
Phil deserves a lot of admiration for this.

The nominating committee has proposed, and the IAB has approved, the
nomination of a new chair for the IETF:

IETF Chair: Paul Mockapetris

Congratulations, Paul.

Dave,

I sent the announcement message of IESG nominations yesterday at 7 pm, just
before leaving office. And during the night, I awake in a bad dream - just
realized I had done a serious mistake, thanking Dave Crocker, Steve Crocker
and Bob Hinden, and forgetting you. I am very sorry of this - there is
certainly nothing personal there, and I certainly do not mean that co-chairing
the Internet area was a lesser accumplishment than application services,
security or routing!
