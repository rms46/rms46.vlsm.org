IPNG Area Report

The IPNG Area is a temporary area in the IESG charged with
managing the "IP the next generation" process.  
This is the first of area reports we will issue approximately
monthly to keep the IETF informed about our progress.

We will give a presentation describing the Area and the
IPng process that we will be pursuing.  This is scheduled for 
Monday morning of the Houston IETF.  We will make the 
announcement of the directorate membership before then
(soon), and we hope that many of the directorate
members will be around during that plenary session.  A 60 minute
time period is reserved for questions and discussion following 
the presentation.  Following the question session will be 10-minute
updates on each of the IPng proposals.

We invited a group of internetters to meet with us for an 
"advice meeting".  This took place at SIGCOMM, in San Francisco,
on September 17.  The purpose of this IPNG meeting
was to give us a kind of focus group, to let us discuss the
IPNG area and the potential IPNG directorate informally and in
a preliminary manner.  The group that met was purposely not an
early version of the IPNG directorate, nor was the
meeting conducted in as structured a way as we expect of
the directorate meetings, i.e. no minutes were taken.

Several results came from this meeting:

-  The directorate should not include IESG or IAB members.

-  An IETF WG, Address Lifetime Expectations (ALE), was formed,
   whose mission is to quantify the lifetime of internet
   address space.  Frank Solensky will chair.

-  Our generalized task is to develop a plan for the
   Internet future--it will have milestones at different
   times depending on the actual growth that occurs.
