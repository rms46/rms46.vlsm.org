                   Definition of Class E IP Addresses


Status of this Memo

   This Internet Draft document will be submitted to the RFC editor for
   a standards document.  Comments and suggestions are welcome and may
   be sent to the authors.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This memo presents an extension to the method of classifying and
   assigning IP network numbers.  It is intended to provide an temporary
   work-around to the imminent exhaustion of Class B network numbers
   until new architectures are developed [1].  It is a product of a
   "birds-of-a-feather" discussion held on July 21, 1991 at the twenty-
   first IETF conference held in Atlanta, GA.

   It should be noted that this document does NOT address the
   limitations inherent in the current routing architectures and
   technology.  Specifically, the issue of scaling is not addressed.

Background

   During the latter part of the 1980's, an ever-increasing number of
   organizations came to realize the advantage and importance of
   allowing their computer systems to interconnect with other systems
   and networks around the globe.  While this is usually seen as a
   positive trend, it has not been without its drawbacks.

   One of the more immediate problems that this sudden growth has
   presented is a continuing heavy demand for Class B network numbers.
   While there are still a very large number of Class C addresses
   available, few organizations expect that their connectivity needs
   will be satisfied within the limitations of 254 IP addresses.

   The level of demand for Class B addresses can be illustrated by a
   short analysis of the data available.  In the period between August
   1990 and June 1991, the number of assigned Class B network numbers
   grew from 2533 to 5654 [2,3].  This averages out to an annual growth
   rate of over 123%.  If this trend were to continue, the pool of
   available Class B network numbers would be depleted by October 1992.

INTERNET DRAFT                                              AUGUST, 1991


   While the authors acknowledge that a logistic or "s-shaped" curve
   would be a more realistic model, a projection based on this assmption
   would not be realistic until we have clearly passed the inflection
   point on the curve - the point at which the curve starts to climb
   less rapidly towards its upper limit.  The data available at this
   time suggests that this leveling off has not yet occured: the annual
   growth rate in the allocation of Class B network numbers between 1983
   and mid-1990 was only 78% [4], indicating that the growth rate is
   continuing to increase.

Class E Network Numbers

   The entire Class E address space will be used for the assignment of
   new IP network numbers.  Within the 28 bits available in Class E
   addresses, the first sixteen will define the network number and the
   remaining twelve will be the local address, as illustrated below.

                          1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                               Class E address

   This approach has the advantage of allowing a more practical network
   size than the Class C address space (4094 addresses as compared to
   254) while reducing the probability that large amounts of numbers
   would remain unused within the network.

   The network number 255.255.240.0 is reserved so that it does not
   conflict with the address reserved for IP broadcasts
   (255.255.255.255).

Revisions to IP Address Classes A and C.

   The space for both Class A and C network numbers will be reduced.
   The low half of these address ranges - network number fields starting
   with "0" - will continue to be used in their present form, as
   illustrated.

                          Revised Class C address

   The upper half of these classes will be redesignated as classes F and
   G.  These are illustrated below.

                          1                   2                   3

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                              Class G address

   This reduces the number of networks in each class to 126 and 1048574
   respectively.  It should be noted, however, the demand for numbers in
   these network classes has not been nearly as great as that for Class
   B.

   The reason for this is that by reserving the upper half of these
   address ranges, there will be sufficient numbering space available to
   develop alternative network number classifications should the need
   arise in the near future.  This may include the restoration of their
   prior interpretations.

   For the sake of completeness, Class B and D addresses are also
   illustrated.  The use of Class D or multicast addresses is specified
   in [5].

Conclusions

   It must be emphasized that this is intended only to be a work-around
   to the problem.  It is by no means a "solution".  While it defines a
   network classification that is four times the size of the original
   Class B space, this will only survive only two years if current
   growth rates continue.  By that time, it is expected that the
   increased amount of network connectivity which has been exhibiting
   similar growth rates [4,6] will cause the computational intensity of
   keeping track of these routes to require an entirely different
   routing and addressing architecture for the Internet such as the one
   described in [5].
