NomCom Chair -- 06 September 2000 -- IETF-Announce
==================================================
List of nomcom volunteers posted



I would like to thank everyone who volunteered for the
IETF nominations committee. The IETF secretariat has
now checked the list of volunteers to verify eligibility
(e.g. has attended at least 2 of the last 3 IETFs).

To make sure that we have received email from everyone
who volunteered, we have posted the list of volunteers
at:
http://www.drizzle.com/~aboba/internaut/nomcom2k.txt

If you volunteered prior to the deadline of September 3, 2000,
and have attended 2 of the last 3 IETFs, please check that
your name appears on the list. If it does not, please send
email to aboba@internaut.com IMMEDIATELY.

Based on the published list, we will run the selection process
and announce the results the week of September 11, 2000.
Ten (10) NomCom voting members will be chosen from the
pool of volunteers according to the procedure described
by Donald Eastlake in RFC 2777, "Publicly Verifiable
Nomcom Random Selection". The source of randomness
will be based on the shares traded number of 12 stocks
selected by the NomCom chair.

The official shares traded numbers (denoted in 000s)
will be drawn from the September 8, 2000 Wall Street
Journal which reports the sales figures from the previous
day - September 7, 2000. If trading in any of the stocks
is suspended, then the shares traded will be assumed to
be 0.

Thank you,

Bernard Aboba <aboba@internaut.com>
