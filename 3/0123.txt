OSI Bash -- April 1993
----------------------

Who was responsible for this quote?


----------------------------------------------------------------------

... I'd like to use it somewhere and I'd like to be able to properly
attribute it correctly...:

     "OSI: Same day service in a nanosecond world"

-- Simon Hackett

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Van Jacobsen.  T-shirt he produced for an Interop, a few years ago.

Not sure what the correct citation format is, to reference a t-shirt.

-- Dave Crocker 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Be careful how you use it. These days there are OSI stacks with the
same or better performance than TCP :-)

-- Eva Kuiper

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Maybe so. Would you care to name them?

-- Steinar Haug

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Can we *please* not start this on the IETF list again?
 
-- John C Klensin

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Before this gets too far along, maybe we should move this discussion 
off the "ietf" list...

And onto, say, "/dev/null"? :-)

-- Frank T Solensky

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BTW, this weekly-based Acronym Serial Notation number 1
(or ASN.1) system was chosen since we've been hearing such
great things about seven layer models on this list
recently....

[* Okay, okay! I'll stop. But they started it!!! :-)  *]

-- Peter Deutsch

You know, it's too bad reality doesn't have a Fast-Forward button, or I'd
sure as hell press it. Presumably, in 10 years, one protocol or the other
will have clearly won, and we will all be spared any more of this constant
bickering and whining. Too bad we have to suffer through the interim,
though..... hibernation, anyone?
