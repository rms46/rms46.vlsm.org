2.  ARCHITECTURAL RETREAT  -- RESULTS AND PLANS

   2.1  Routing and Addressing

      Cerf: There is a critical need to put together a small task group
      to generate at least one feasible proposal for large-scale Routing
      and Addressing in the Internet.  Its output will be a contribution
      to an anticipated IETF WG, which will review the issues and
      converge on a plan for updating Internet routing and addressing.

      The group specified that minutes from this task group's meetings
      must be freely available, and its work results would be available
      as an Internet Draft.  The target of this group would be to define
      a feasible solution by March 1992, in time for the San Diego IETF.

      After some discussion on the structure and makeup of the task
      group and the division of the leadership responsibilities, the
      consensus was that there should be three specific separate
      leadership roles:  meeting chairperson, document editor, and
      "floor manager" to coordinate the activities.

         NEW ACTION: Cerf: Talk to principals and convene first meeting
            of Routing & Addressing task group.
