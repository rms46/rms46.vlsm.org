           Version: 1) to Historic 


Last Call Resend without the typo in the subject line.

The IESG has received a request to consider reclassifying RFC1240 'OSI
Connectionless Transport Services on top of UDP - Version: 1' as an
Historic document.  

The IESG will also review OSI connectionless transport services on top
of UDP Applicability Statement for Historic Status
<draft-bradner-1240.his-00.txt> as an Informational RFC.

The IESG plans to make a decision in the next few weeks, and solicits
final comments on this action.  Please send any comments to the
iesg@cnri.reston.va.us or ietf@ietf.org mailing lists by
February 06,1999.
