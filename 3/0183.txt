No.  It is important to understand that the IANA role and the
RFC Editor one were _always_ separate, although some of the same
people were historically involved in both and, again
historically, both operated under Jon Postel's management.

Again, no.  Many of us find ourselves wearing multiple hats.  I
don't know the financial arrangements between ISI and ICANN that
support the two arrangements for Joyce's time, but she is less
than full time on either of them.   I.e., part of her time
involves RFC Editor work (and the related liaison to IAB),
another involves some efforts on ICANN's part.  As described in
the most recent IAB Charter, there is also provision for a
liaison from the IANA: while that position is now vacant, we
assume it will soon be filled and do not expect that Joyce be
the person filling that role.

If she were working full time for ICANN, and not at all for ISI,
or if the RFC Editor function consisted of ICANN (and not ISI)
staff, this would be an interesting observation and conclusion.
But neither is the case.

Again, the RFC Editor and IANA functions are separate and always
have been.  There are useful synergies between the two
activites, which is why we have welcomed close coordination, but
your confusion is due to assuming that the two are really the
same.

IANA has traditionally had several functions, and some of the
boundaries periodically create confusion.  We are satisfied with
the present relationships and hence see no prospect for having
to change then.   However, we believe that there is a fairly
general understanding among IAB, ICANN, and US DoC that the IAB
could, indeed, transfer the portions of the IANA efforts that
relate to IETF work elsewhere if that were necessary or
desirable.
