NomCom -- 21 October 1999 -- IETF-Announce
------------------------------------------

NomCom Reminder 

Hello,

I wanted to remind people that the deadline for volunteering for the
NomCom is October 22, 1999.  The volunteer pool is growing,
and I am grateful to those who have already volunteered.  Please
remember that the more people we have in the volunteer pool,
the better chance we have of selecting a NomCom which represents
the diversity of populations and opinions to be found in the IETF. 

To qualify you must have attended 2 out of the last 3 IETF meetings.  
You must also not be interested in being nominated to replace any of the 
current office holders in the following positions:
