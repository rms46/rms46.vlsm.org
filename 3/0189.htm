<P>
This is a complaint against the IESG and the RFC-Editor about
publication of RFC-2188 (Efficient Short Remote Operations - ESRO) as
an Informational RFC. A lot went wrong in the process of publication
of RFC-2188. The highlights are:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>The publication of the RFC was delayed for *8 months* for no good reason.
<LI>During the period from the day of submission to the day of publication
      (8 months) there was only one  technical email exchange
      related to this RFC and the RFC was published exactly as 
      it was submitted (plus the IESG note).
<LI>The IESG was irresponsible and negligent in fulfilling its role.
<LI>The RFC-Editor was negligent in fulfilling its role.
<LI>In practice, the publicized processes and procedures for the 
      Informational RFC publication were not being followed neither by
      the IESG and nor by the RFC-Editor.
<LI>In practice, RFC-Editor was reduced to a puppet of IESG acting as 
      a glorified secretary and an inefficient messenger.
<LI>The IESG over stepped the scope of its authority
      and displayed an arrogant an dictatorial attitude 
      which caused serious delays in the publication of
      the RFC.
</UL>
<P>
I (Mohsen Banan - mohsen@neda.com) have used very strong words in the
above list to characterize the problems in this specific case. Use of
those words are in no way extreme. Use of ALL of those words are
justified in this message.

<P>
The fact that a lot went wrong in the case of publication of RFC-2188
is known to many. Steve Coya and Scott Brander have admitted that
there were a number of problems and have apologized for them.

<P>
<PRE>
  Scott Bradner&gt; ... the iesg fucked up and I'm trying to fix the issue ...

  Steve Coya&gt; You DO have a valid complaint, but not with the RFC Editors.

  Scott Bradner&gt; ...  As I said things slipped through 
  Scott Bradner&gt; the cracks and I am sorry that happened. ...
</PRE>
<P>
I accepted their apologies and after the publication of RFC-2188 I was
going to let this drop. However, since then I have seen even more
evidence of the IESG being way out of control and now feel that 
something needs to be done. 

<P>
This note is complete and includes all that is necessary to allow
people to judge for themselves the validity of my complaints.

<P>
My goal is to PRESERVE the so far mostly open Informational RFC
publication process from censorship by the likes of IESG.  We need to
find a way to ensure that what went wrong in this case never happens
again. I am preparing this complaint because I think that it can help
a number of areas which are critical to the continued success of the
Internet.

<P>
In the absence of any sort of accountability by the IESG and the
RFC-Editor to anyone, I am hoping that peer pressure and public
embarrassment can be used as tools to bring the IESG under control and
restore the Information RFC publication process to the open process
that it is supposed to be.

<P>
Internet Standards are better than other standards
because we realize that no entity (IETF/IESG/IAB) has
exclusivity on good ideas. Many (if not most)
good/successful Internet protocols have come from
outside of committees, task forces, groups or
boards. (If you are looking for examples, consider
the web.)

<P>
Fair and equitable access to the RFC publication service is
fundamental to the success and growth of the Internet.  Good protocols
(as well as bad protocols) coming from outside of the IETF should have
access to the RFC publication service, so that they can be used and
even sometimes compete with IETF/IESG work. The network and the market
place ultimately decides the winners and the loosers.

<P>
Now, my experience with the publication of RFC-2188 has convinced me
that:

<P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI>
the IESG frequently abuses its authority and in fact is allowed to
delay the publication of RFCs indefinitely and even engage in
censorship of material that it just does not like or that it does not
understand.

<P>
<LI>
both the IESG and the RFC-Editor operate with an "authority"
oriented attitude as opposed to a "responsibility" oriented
attitude.

<P>
<LI>
in practice there are not adequate checks and balances in the
process to guard against mistakes by the IESG or the RFC-Editor.

<P>
</UL>
<P>
If any of the above is true we have a problem. Unfortunately, this
note clearly demonstrates that all of the above were true in the case
of RFC-2188.  I am also now convinced that the problems in the case of
RFC-2188 were not isolated to that case alone. There is a serious
problem.

<P>
The rest of this note substantiates my claims about the problem.
Because this deals with a concrete and specific case, because it deals
with history of what has already happened, because it is a complete case, I
hope that this note can be used to identify and fix the serious
problems that exist.

<P>
Because this note is documentation of a complete case, it is somewhat
lengthy.

<P>
This note is organized in 4 sections.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00001000000000000000">
Info RFC Publication In Theory and in Practice</A>
</H2>

<P>
In theory, "The Internet Standards Process" (BCP-9, RFC-2026) defines
at a high level a very reasonable process for publication of non IETF
protocols as Informational RFCs. The problem is that in practice that
process is not followed. The IESG is allowed to indefinitely delay
the publication of RFCs or simply reject them because the IESG does
not get them or because the IESG does not like them.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00002000000000000000">
Info RFC Publication In Theory</A>
</H2>

<P>
The highlights of the process of publication of non IETF protocols as
Informational RFCs (taken from sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 of RFC-2026)
are:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Informational designation does not represent an 
      Internet recommendation of any sort.

<P>
<LI>Publication of Informational RFCs is supposed to be 
      "timely".

<P>
<LI>The RFC-Editor (and NOT the IESG) is responsible for
     determining suitability for publication based on:
	 <UL>
<LI>Relevance to Internet activity
<LI>Meets the technical standard for RFCs
<LI>Meets the editorial standard for RFCs
	 </UL>
<P>
<LI>The RFC-Editor refers the document to the IESG 
      for review which is to be in a timely manner.
      The scope of IESG's review of the document is 
      to identify areas of overlap with on going or 
      future IETF activities. 

<P>
<UL>
<LI>The IESG can recommend that the document be
              brought in the IETF.
<LI>The IESG can determine that the document
              conflicts with or is inimical to an established
              IETF effort.

<P>
In that case the document may still be published
              as an Informational RFC with an IESG disclaimer.
	 </UL></UL>
<P>
This process is very reasonable. Irrelevant or sub-standard
specifications (such as Internet Porn Protocol - IPP) will be stoped
by the RFC-Editor. Reasonable protocols get a chance to be published
in a timely manner. The IESG is not allowed to censor anything in
favor of its own activities or opinions.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00003000000000000000">
Practice</A>
</H2>

<P>
In practice the role of the RFC Editor for documents coming from
outside of the IETF/IESG/IAB has been reduced to that of a glorified
clerk of the IESG. In other words in practice the IESG has already
expanded its limited role as a conflict detector to a commentator and
the authorative reviewer and the final decision maker.

<P>
In practice, the RFC Editor is not in charge the IESG is.

<P>
Neither the IESG, nor the RFC Editor have any respect for the
requirement of "timely" processing of the non IETF Informational
RFCs.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00004000000000000000">
Un-Answered Questions</A>
</H2>

<P>
During the process of publication of RFC-2188 when it became obvious
that the process being followed is not that of BCP-9. I started asking
the following questions. These questions were asked a number of times
from the RFC-Editor and the IESG. They have never responded to any of
them. They remain unanswered.

<P>
<UL>
<LI>
What process is the RFC Editor following for the publication of
Informational RFCs (since it clearly is not the process define in
BCP-9)?

<P>
<LI>
What do "reasonable period of time" and "timely" mean to the 
  RFC Editor and the IESG?

<P>
<LI>
What does the IESG think the scope and purpose of its review of 
the non IETF RFCs are?

<P>
<LI>
What is the RFC Editor expected to do when the IESG does not
  review the document in a reasonable period of time?

<P>
<LI>
Who do the RFC Editor and the IESG find themselves accountable to?

<P>
<LI>
What should the Author of an RFC do when its repeated questions and
concerns are simply ignored?
</UL>
<P>
In light of everything that happened in the case of RFC-2188, I
consider all of these questions valid and legitimate. These questions
have been asked many times to no avail. They remain unanswered.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00010000000000000000">
Recommendations For Improvements</A>
</H1>

<P>
Because of the RFC-2188 experience and other interactions that I have
had with the IESG and the RFC-Editor, I have some suggestions for
improving the non IETF Informational RFC publication process and
practice.

<P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI>Recognize what IESG really is and what its role is supposed to be.
       Limit the IESG's role to what it is supposed to be.

<P>
The IESG is a hand-full of volunteer engineers with a fancy
       group name. Based on my interactions with them, I have
       concluded that they hardly reach the "average" level of
       competence in my book - both in their technical and in their
       management abilities. The IESG often has little relevant
       experience and knowledge in the specialized subject matter of
       the RFCs that it needs to review.

<P>
Instead of functioning in its limited co-ordination and
       conflict detector role as defined in section 4.2.3, in practice
       the IESG has already expanded its own role and has assumed ultimate
       authority over publication/non-publication of non IETF
       originated Informational RFCs.

<P>
The IESG should not be permitted to engage in censorship or delay of
publication of work coming from outside of IETF because they just
don't like it, because they don't understand it, because they think
that it may be competing with IETF/IESG work or because they think
that it may be bad for the Internet.

<P>
Based on the case of RFC-2188, I have concluded that the IESG
       is out of control and irresponsible. It needs to be checked and
       managed.

<P>
<LI>Strengthen the RFC-Editor's Role.

<P>
In practice
the role of the RFC Editor for documents coming from
outside of the IETF/IESG/IAB has been reduced to that
of a glorified clerk of the IESG. 

<P>
If and when the IESG does not complete its review of the refered
documents, it is the RESPONSIBILITY of the RFC Editor to go ahead and
publish the document. The RFC Editor should not permit the IESG
to introduce long delays in the publication of documents.

<P>
The RFC Editor should ensure that the IESG note going into an
Informational RFC is in fact reasonable and correct and provide the
author an opportunity to see the IESG note prior to publication.

<P>
The RFC Publication Service can benefit from
additional resources. I am pretty sure that getting
funding for such a critical service is not going to be
difficult if we look at it the right way.

<P>
<LI>Ensure that the procedures of BCP-9 are followed in practice.

<P>
The spirit of sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 of BCP-9 is just right.

<P>
However, the case of RFC-2188 clearly shows that in practice the
 procedures of BCP-9 are not being followed.

<P>
We need to find a way to make sure that what BCP-9 says is in fact
 what happens.

<P>
<LI>Introduce more accountability, structure and order 
to the RFC publication service.

<P>
Tighten BCP-9 to be more clear about minimum technical 
   requirements for RFCs. Introduce an appeals process for 
   when a document is rejected. More clearly define "timely"...
   
   Provide mechanisms that safeguard against mistakes and negligence
   by the IESG or the RFC Editor.

<P>
Define specifically, what is supposed to happen when the IESG does
   not complete its limited review in a timely manner.

<P>
Re-orient everything towards responsibilities of the publication
   service providers instead of their authorities.

<P>
<LI>Separate The RFC Publication Service from 
      the IETF/IESG/IAB.

<P>
The RFC Editor task is primarily a Publication
Service. The IETF/IESG/IAB is JUST one of the
users/customers of the the RFC Publication Service.

<P>
There has been talk of putting the RFC Publication Service under
management and funding of IETF/IESG/IAB/ISOC. That would be totally
wrong.

<P>
There is an obvious inherent problem with allowing a common
 Publication Service to be managed and funded by one of its users. The
 problem is that IETF/IESG/IAB is likely to claim control over the
 entire RFC Publication Service and delay the publication or exclusion
 of protocols coming from outside of it and suppress standards
 competition  even more.

<P>
Clear separation of powers is a good thing. It is a good way of 
introducing accountability and checks and balances. 

<P>
A powerful and independent RFC Editor role which would oversee a fair
and equitable RFC Publication service is ESSENTIAL for the Internet.

<P>
In practice, the RFC Editor role has been weakened over the years.  We
need to strengthen it.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00011000000000000000">
Limiting IETF/IESG/IAB's role in the RFC Publication Process</A>
</H2>

<P>
Let's look at what needs to happen in the bigger
picture. Standardization process iterates through
4 essentially distinct steps.

<P>
<DL>
<DD><P>
<DT><STRONG>1) Development of the Protocol.</STRONG>
<DD><P>
IETF/IESG are just one of the entities
      developing protocols. Many good protocols are
      developed by non-standards related entities.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>2) Publication of the Protocol.</STRONG>
<DD><P>
A wide open, quick and fair publication service is needed to
      allow for anyone who wants to build or play with protocols to
      have access to its specification.  The fundamental
      characteristics of the RFC Publication Service for the most part
      have been working real well. Any relevant protocol coming from
      essentially anywhere which meets a minimum technical and/or
      editorial standard should have speedy access to the RFC
      Publication Service.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>3) Use of the Protocol.</STRONG>
<DD><P>
If it is anything useful and is done right, it
      will be used. How it gets used is very important
      and unpredictable.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>4) Blessing of the Protocol.</STRONG>
<DD><P>
Some entity (e.g., IETF/IESG/IAB) blesses the
      protocol by putting some label on it. Although
      necessary, this function is mostly
      ceremonial. The real legitimacy comes from usage
      and the market place.
</DL>
<P>
Without a question, IETF/IESG/IAB should play some
role in step (1).

<P>
Without a question, IETF/IESG/IAB need to focus on
step (4).

<P>
But, I am saying that putting step (2) under
management and funding of IETF/IESG/IAB/ISOC is
WRONG. Because it has the potential of further
suppressing the results of step (1) coming from
outside of IETF/IESG.

<P>
Note, that I don't have a problem with the spirit of
the relationship between The RFC-Editor and
IETF/IESG/IAB/ISOC as described in BCP-9. My point is
that by making step (2) completely and truly
independent of management and funding by
IETF/IESG/IAB/ISOC, we will bring about the necessary
checks and balances that are needed for a healthy
overall process which needs to even encourage
competition in step (1).

At that time our only contact point was the RFC Editor.  The Editor
neglected to reply to that message.  Those questions remain unanswered

After more than 6 months, this is the first time that anyone at the

that the IESG requested that the document not be published.  This is a
clear violation of the procedures of BCP-9. No where in RFC 2026 is
the IESG given the authority to stop the publication of a non IETF
Informational RFC. Now, add to that the level of arrogance that says
IESG can ignore the Authors' inquiries for 6 months and provide no
explanation what-so-ever to why IESG has prevented the publication of
the RFC. Then add to it, that later it becomes clear that Steve Coya
was just wrong.

<DT><STRONG>August 8, 97 - Mohsen BANAN To Scott Bradner:</STRONG>
<DD><P>
The Authors choose the Informational RFC route because the urgency for
publication in this case outweighs our interest in getting this
document on the standards track.

Scott Bradner forwards a technical comment from Harald Alvestrand to
the Authors.  This is the *ONLY* technical comment that we ever
received from the IESG or the RFC Editor.

If there was to be an IESG Note, I wanted to have a chance and see it
before publication.

Scott Bradner informs us that he publication was approved by the IESG.
But does not mention anything about the IESG note.

<DT><STRONG>September 9, 97 - Mohsen BANAN To Scott Bradner:</STRONG>
<DD><P>
I ask about the expected publication date.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>September 9, 97 - RFC Editor to IETF-Announce:</STRONG>
<DD><P>
The RFC Editor announces publication of RFC-2188.

<P>
The text of RFC-2188 is materially same as what we submitted to the
RFC Editor on Jan 15, 1997, with the exception of the IESG note.

<P>
To our surprise we discovered the following IESG note in our RFC. 

<P>
<PRE>
IESG Note

   This protocol has not had the benefit of IETF Working Group review,
   but a cursory examination reveals several issues which may be
   significant issues for scalability.  A site considering deployment
   should conduct a careful analysis to ensure they understand the
   potential impacts.
</PRE>
<P>
A few key points about this IESG Note:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>The Authors were never given a chance to know about any of the issues 
      that the note implies, even-though I had explicitly asked to be
      informed of communications related to this RFC.

<P>
<LI>After delaying the publication for 8 months, why is the IESG Note based on 
 "a cursory examination".

<P>
<LI>If that IESG Note is true, then why were the Authors not given a chance to
   know about them and fix them? 

<P>
<LI>If that IESG Note is true, then why did the Area Director want to put it 
  on the Standards Track and issue a Last Call for it?

<P>
<LI>The IESG note is so vague that up until recently I thought that it was about the 
  wrong perception of limitations of Service Access Points - which
  was the ONLY technical issue that was ever discussed with the
  Authors. How can the IESG expect that such an unsubstantiated vague
  comment be of use to anyone?  The best I can gather, this appears to
  have just been a "power trip" by an out of control IESG.
<LI>I am not saying that RFC-2188 is perfect and that no IESG note 
 should have ever been put in it. I am saying that the IESG note that
 was put in there was done the wrong way and is of little use, if any.

<P>
</UL>
<P>
</DL>
<P>
If any of my employees were to ever be responsible for a small fraction
of the types of arrogance, negligence and mistakes that were commited
during the process of publication of RFC-2188, I would fire or demote
them immediately.

<P>
But, the IESG is a collection of volunteers which answers to no one.

<P>
Unless we can find a way to deal with problems like this and fix them,
I am afraid that arrogance, negligence, irresponsibility and
incompetence will be institutionalized inside of the IESG.

<P>

ALL of the messages related to this case that I originated or received
starting from the time of initial submission up until the time of
publication of the RFC are included as 30 email messages below. Other
than deleting the attachments of the original specification, these
messages have not been edited in any way.

<P>
My interactions with individulas at the IESG and the RFC Editor were
in the context of them functioning in their roles as Service
Providers. I consider none of these email messages private or personal
or confidential.
