NomCom Chair -- 13 January 1994 -- IETF

IAB/IESG Nominating Committee Selection Results


Since the announcement of the IESG/IAB Nominating Committee on December 22,
I have received messages from 58 individuals indicating an ability to work
on the committee; of these, three fill liason positions (ex officio
non-voting), and two persons were disqualified, having not attended at
least two IETF meetings.

Among these, I found men and women, people from three continents (four if
one considers an Israeli living in the US to be Mid-eastern),
representatives from vendors, transit and regional networks, research,
educational institutions, and government. One of my first respondents
(disqualified, unfortunately, because although he had attended the Kobe and
San Francisco INET meetings, he had never attended an IETF meeting) was an
official with the UN's World Health Organization.

Last night, I powwowed with my pastor, Rick Ryan of Calvary Chapel Santa
Barbara. I had a box with 53 names in it. Rob Laskin of CMC observed. From
the box, Rick selected seven members and three alternates.
