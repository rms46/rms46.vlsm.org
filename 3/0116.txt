ISOC Chair -- 20 January 1993 -- IETF
-------------------------------------

IESG and IAB Nominations committee


Folks,

just a week ago, I sent out a brief message to advise you
that Jeff Case had agreed to serve as chairman of the
IAB and IESG nominations committee for the 1993 nominations
cycle. He has set up a mailbox: ietfnom@cs.utk.edu  and
is accepting volunteers.

The list of volunteers is growing, but the collective interest
would be served by having a large field of qualified talent
to select from. If you haven't volunteered and can meet the
criteria (attendance at two IETFs), please give serious 
consideration. The work is vital to the future of the Internet
and your participation is needed.

I thank those of you who have already made this commitment;
encourage your colleagues to join you.
