Confirmation of new IAB Slate

The IAB/IESG Nominating Committee is pleased to announce that its slate
of new members for the IAB has recently been formally confirmed by the
ISoc Board of Trustees.

Although there will be a formal announcement at this Thursday's
Plenary, we would like IETF members to be aware that the newly
appointed IAB members are:

Steve Bellovin
Brian Carpenter
Jon Crowcroft
Robert Elz
John Klensin
Radia Perlman

These six join the six whose terms are *not* expiring this year:

J Allard
Elise Gerich
Erik Huizer
Robert Moskowitz
Yakov Rekhter
Chris Weider

Each of us should also extend our thanks to the outgoing IAB members,
Steve Crocker, Phill Gross, Christian Huitema, and Lixia Zhang, for
their contributions while serving on the current IAB.

Regards,
-- Guy
Chair, NomCom
