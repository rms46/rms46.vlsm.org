             Summary of Internet Architecture Discussion
                          January 8-9, 1991

  1. INTRODUCTION

The Internet Activities Board (IAB) met with the Internet Engineering
    Steering Group (IESG) on January 8-9, 1991 at the USC Information
    Sciences Institute in Marina del Rey, CA. The meeting devoted the
    afternoon of the first day and the morning of the second day to an
    extended discussion of the future directions for Internet
    architecture. This document reports on this architecture
    discussion, which was led by Dave Clark. The minutes of the rest
    of the meeting are reported elsewhere.

  2. DEFINING THE PROBLEM

The first afternoon was spent trying to define the problems to be
    solved. Clark began the discussion with a presentation of his view
    of the key issues; his slides are reproduced in Appendix A. Each
    of his topic slides (7-12) were then discussed in turn.
    2.1 The Multi-Protocol Internet [Slide 7]

The discussion began by setting a timeframe for evolution of the
    Internet and the TCP/IP protocol suite. This timeframe determines
    the importance of several issues, in particular routing and
    addressing. It was accepted that OSI is not yet here, and the
    general feeling was that it will not be for some time. A question:
    does OSI lead or follow current technology? Alternative scenarios
    were:

 1. OSI and TCP/IP both live forever,
 2. TCP/IP fades,
 3. OSI fades,
 4. Next Generation replaces both.

Debate ensued over the merit of evolving two protocol suites in
tandem; some advocated friendly competition, while others called it a
waste of effort which could lead to the demise of both.

One alternative discussed was to redirect IAB/IETF efforts to
emphasize OSI, devoting all our resources to making OSI a reality.
Such actions could include profiling standards, merging standards, and
fixing broken OSI standards. However, it was observed that the IAB can
only have direct influence over protocols that it controls; an effort
based on profiling other protocols is not likely to be successful.

Here is a sample of comments on this topic, lightly paraphrased:
  * "The answer will come from the grass roots; people won't switch
    unless the old suite breaks or the new one has more features".
  * "Are we asking the wrong question? We're facing really
    heterogeneous networks, and must include variety in our thinking".
  * "The IAB can exert more leadership over the (only) suite that it
    controls".
  * "Even productive competition may be a diversion of effort; we may
    be getting too complex".
  * "If the goal is interoperation, the world must agree on the
    protocol basis; right now that means TCP/IP".
  * "I prefer TCP/IP because
  * prefer the [development and standardization] process [of the
    IAB/IETF]".
  * "I am sympathetic to the concern about dilution of effort, but
  * doubt that there is really a tradeoff; it will be different
    people".

The concensus most nearly supported the continuation of parallel
development of both TCP/IP and OSI suites.

 2.2 Routing and Addressing [Slide 8]

The problems of routing and addressing may be strongly affected by the
    rise of commercial common carrier networks. Some of the scaling
    and topology problems we experience today will look different as
    access control and topology become important aspects of the
    interconnection of commercial service providers.
    The target size of the Internet is an important consideration. One
    viewpoint expressed was that commercial common carriers will
    dominate, so we only have to wait for them to solve our problems
    of routing and addressing. However, the more widely held viewpoint
    was that, while the topology may eventually be whatever the common
    carriers give us, we cannot count on their providing us the
    complete service we want. The Internet must be seen as a large and
    diverse system, and the evolving architecture must be able to deal
    with combined public/private Internet with a very large address
    space.
    Currently there are many different grades of service, rather than
    one uniform service. It was suggested that a package
    transportation service is a better service analogy than the
    telephone system. Thus, the telephone system offers a homogeneous
    service, while planes, ships, trains all transport packages but
    offer different grades of service. Such a diverse infrastructure
    is needed in internetting.
    It seemed likely that some policy-based routing will be necessary.
    If we assume that the Internet architecture will continue in use
    indefinitely, then we need flexibility.
    Multicast was a controversial topic. Currently there are no
    applications available that can make use of its facilities.
    However, there are some future uses of multicast, including
    routing, mailing lists, and mass distributions.

 2.3 Getting BIG [Slide 9]

Getting big presents several obstacles. The IAB's past X.500
    deployment planning effort was discussed as an example of the
    problems that can arise. The problem was partly that X.500 is an
    international standard, hard to adapt.
    It was suggested that testing new services like X.500 in the
    Internet can be very valuable, but it is possible only when there
    is government funding: "For success in applications testing, you
    need to find a sugar daddy". We need more tools for applications
    -- IPC, RPC, authentication -- but unfortunately funding for
    applications development is largely missing. It is important to
    distinguish research from infrastructure development.

 2.4 Dealing with Divestiture [Slide 10]

A number of points were made.

  * The introduction of commercial services and the need for
    accounting will impact the protocols.
  * We need to develop a variety of means for measurement and
    accounting; pricing can be determined later.
  * Charging may lead to protocol changes to minimize costs, and the
    consequences are unpredictable.
  * There is no difference in the mechanics of accounting information
    collection between a connection-oriented and a connectionless
    network. However, billing on a per-packet basis in a datagram
    network could lead to very high overhead.
  * There is a need for authentication, to prevent fraud.
  * The ability to share a common link between two or more
    administrations is needed.

 2.5 New Services [Slide 11]

Video is an important new service. Video is defined here as a point to
    point frame-oriented delay-sensitive service. There is a need to
    do this in a few years, just ahead of the 200MIPs multimedia
    workstation.
    Distributed computing and transaction protocols need to be
    developed. There is an authentication problem in an operating
    system when a transaction just appears at a host. One problem with
    running real distributed applications in the Internet has been the
    need to set up a lot of configuration information at each end.
    It was also observed that even so simple a distributed application
    as the DNS does not work very well, so we need to do a lot more
    work on distributed application tools.

 2.6 Security [Slide 12]

We need more sophistated models of authentication.
    Application relays make it hard to build new applications.

  3. ARCHITECTURAL SOLUTIONS

It was intended that the second part of the discussion would home in
    on some solutions. However, the group was far from a concensus on
    most issues. Therefore, the time was spent in detailed viewpoint
    presentations by a number of the participants.
 3.1 Vint Cerf

Cerf opened with a list of assertions about the future of the
    Internet.

 1. It is less important that a particular technical prediction
    actually occurs than it is that the architecture makes it
    POSSIBLE.
 2. All technologies are eventually overtaken by new ones. Must
    accomodate PEAK requirements, and must also be prepared for some
    technologies to linger long past their peak.
 3. The number of "terminations" (e.g., IP addresses) per person
    varies from .001 to 1000.
 4. Total terminations ~ P/4 * 3 * 10, where P = number of persons =
    250M, 3 corresponds to home + 2 workers, and the last factor of 10
    is for safety. Implies terminations ~ 2*10**9 for US, 36*10**9 for
    the world.
    Note that the phone system has extremely high fan-out, Internet
    fan-out is much lower. Can (will? should?) this change?
 5. The routing problem is a function of the number of networks and
    the topology (hierarchy). Suppose we separate HOST# from NET#, and
    place NET# into a hierarchical structure with provision for
    "break-out". Would 32 bits of NET# be enough to cover the
    administrative overhead of delegated assignment of address space?
    Strawman:

   NET#
32    HOST#
32
    where NET# is hierarchical, and HOST# is perhaps globally unique.
    [Debate on this was postponed.]
 6. Hosts incapable of supporting DNS and other core requirements must
    ultimately be abandoned to their fate (when can we stop catering
    to them?). Backward compatibility need not be absolute; a rational
    window of new and old technology should be defined.
    Within each protocol suite, there must be a "central, core" set of
    protocols that defines the network architecture.
    The question was raised: At what level should multi-protocols
    exist: IP, Mail, Postscript?

Cerf continued with a proposed list of requirements, and attempted to
gather from the group a general sense of agreement or uncertainty
about each one (noted in square brackets).

 1. Must support more than one protocol suite operating concurrently.
    It is NOT required that they interwork with each other. Some
    common applications might be usefully interworked.
    [Much discussion].
 2. Must be able to accomodate transmission bandwidths 2.4Kbps (?) to
    over 10 Gbps.
    [Not universal agreement; perhaps lower end should be increased.]
 3. Must accomodate new switching and transmission media wherever
    possible (e.g., SMDS; ISDN; BISDN; Frame Relay; optically-
    switched networks; color-multiplexed, tuned-laser nets, and radio
    technology).
    [Agreed]
 4. Must accomodate an address space for 36*10**9 terminations,
    1*10**9 networks.

   NET#
32    HOST#
32
    [Needs debate]
 5. Must accomodate private and public network components.
    [Agreed]
 6. Must support (at least, not inhibit) collection of statistics for
    accounting, billing.
    [Agreed: need example billing and reconciliation scenarios, and
    need reverse charging. Need debate: IP "charge code" option,
    authenticable charge codes. Question: in what level of
    architecture do these features show up??]
 7. Must support administratively-restricted connectivity.
    May be at different layers.
       + Security constraints (IPSO)
       + Closed/partially open "user groups"
       + DNS "tailoring" (non-uniform configuration)?
       + Router configuration tables (e.g., NSFNET configuration)
    [Needs discussion.]
 8. Must support several classes of service.
    (Pick a few to start, e.g., "guaranteed bandwidth", "bounded
    delay", and figure out how they might work. What if not
    supportable by all networks?)
    [General agreement]
 9. Must provide for end-to-end authenticated and/or secure (private)
    communication.
       + Application level, so that authentication/privacy survives
         across application-level relay.
       + Transport level?
       + SNMP
       + Routing Protocols
       + DNS/X.500?
       + Playback-immune authentication
    [General agreement]
10. Support host mobility.
    Initiate communications FROM "mobile" host
    => temporary binding of IP address (PPP, SLIP). EASY CASE (?).
    Receive communications when mobile (or at destination)
    => dynamic tracking of mobile address. HARD!
    Would dynamic name/address binding suffice?
    How to authenticate DNS update?
    Delay and responsiveness?
    (Some network technologies make it easy).
    [Timescale is an issue. Maybe not at high speed? (Rate of change
    of connectivity is the big issue). What about military
    applications?]

 3.2 Christian Huitema

Huitema saw the biggest problem in the Internet as one of getting big,
    or rather, "getting wide". Topology is moving to multiple
    backbones and multiple registries.
    To scale to the sizes we are considering, a fully dynamic routing
    process is impossible. What is needed is a directory of address to
    network translations and routing info. Flooding of routing
    information should be replaced by a route server, which can either
    hold pre-computed routes or compute routes as needed.

 3.3 Noel Chiappa

Security is the key to the future evolution of the Internet. The
    solution to this problem will dictate the architecture of the rest
    of the system.

 3.4 Bob Hinden

Hinden commented on each of the topic slides.

 1. Multi-Protocol Internet
    It would be nice to have one protocol suite, but we must live with
    both TCP/IP and OSI.
    A useful strategy might be to feed TCP/IP protocol developments
    into OSI process (e.g., BGP -> IDRP).
 2. Routing and Addressing
       + Need 1 to 2 orders of magnitude growth.
       + Addresses should be identifiers, logically distinct from
         routes.
       + We will have to impose a hierarchical structure to handle
         growth. A 3-tier topology (backbone, regional, private) is
         sufficient, but it must provide for arbitrary
         interconnections.
       + Policy: Source controlled. Backbone, regional, private
         networks will support distinct policies (where they provide
         parallel service).
       + Mobile host support would be desirable.
       + Multicasting will not be useful until there are real
         applications.
 3. Getting Big
    Applications are badly needed.
       + Make email good enough for commerce.
       + Desktop conferencing with video.
       + Bulletin board paradigm: it is powerful and should be
         exploited more.
       + Information collection (Knowbots?)
       + Video retrieval and libraries.
       + Distributed simulation.
 4. Divestiture
       + Does not believe common carriers will provide universal
         service ("the Cheriton conjecture"); we will still need to do
         internetting.
       + Need accounting, not billing.
 5. New Services
    Video is very important.
 6. Security
    The network needs to protect itself: control protocols need
    security.
    The network should provide an authentication service. All other
    security needed by an application can be end-to-end.

 3.5 Russ Hobby

Hobby emphasized the need for new applications. Tools are needed for
    building distributed applications, including RPC and standard
    presentation formats. Both personal communication and "virtual
    computer" applications need work. There is a pressing need to
    recruit a set of experts and secure funding for them.

 3.6 Joyce Reynolds

Reynolds enumerated a list of needed user services. There is a need to
    international coordination and for more publicity. A network
    information services infrastructure and yellow pages are needed.
    Issues of copyright and intellectual property need to be explored.

 3.7 Dave Crocker

Crocker identified the need for upper layer development. There is a
    missing skill set in the IETF, presentation and applications
    development. There is a need to begin hiding the complexity of the
    network.

 3.8 Tony Lauck

Lauck presented many points.

 1. Architecture is more than the protocols, it is addressing.
 2. Relays are a necessary evil, because of history, pragmatics, and
    especially corporate security policies. Better Internet security
    will result in fewer relays. The IAB should work to limit the
    growth of relays.
 3. There is not chance to constrain the development of multiple
    protocol suites; they are here today. Beware of problems of
    testing interoperability, with exponential combinations at various
    layers.
 4. The size of the Internet is not a big issue. 10**9? 10**11?
    10**12?
 5. In large networks, addresses, routes, and topology must be related
    for reasonable performance -- log(n) vs. n. Hierarchy is
    sub-optimal, but at least it is possible, and will allow the
    construction of large networks.
 6. Policy routing is all solutions with no questions.
 7. Support for mobile hosts is needed, to make them more useful for
    personal work.
 8. Multicast has marginal value, could be dangerous.
 9. Phase out fragmentation, it's a mistake in IP that OSI copied.
10. The network should support devices ranging from small thermostats
    to large supercomputers.
11. Charging is important because without it there is little
    motivation to develop new applications. The ban on commercial use
    also restricts innovation.
12. Must have controls for limited sharing of links. Hard problem is
    to keep this simple.
13. Transaction processing standards are complex and farther along in
    OSI.
14. Distributed processing is coming (slowly) in OSI. We should work
    with existing efforts in these applications.
15. End node cannot be the only point for security. Mis- configuration
    is a real danger and the Internet should be able to defend itself.
16. Global authentication is most important part of distributed
    processing.

 3.9 Ross Callon

Callon discussed the coexistence of multiple protocol suites, starting
    from a series of questions:

 1. What is meta-architecture for a multi-protocol Internet?
 2. Does the concept of a "pure suite" exist? For example, the
    Internet includes other defacto standards like NFS and Postscript.
 3. Might it make sense to fill the holes in one suite using protocols
    from another suite?
 4. This does not break the notion of distinct TCP/IP and OSI protocol
    suites, but it might be a good idea to break it.

The idea of merely sharing the links and letting the rest of the
protocol stack be different defeats interoperability. He proposed to
chip away at the differences by sharing: routing, user agents,
directories (DNS-X.500 merge), mail protocols (SMTP exchange of X.400
format), ODA and RDI, and EDI. This sharing would unify the
architecture, save some effort, and enhance interoperability.

 3.10 Lyman Chapin

The Internet will change with the introduction of commercial carriers.
    A multi-protocol-suite Internet is currently a necessity, although
    this is not best architectural choice. OSI efforts really need the
    input of the IETF community. There is the very real possibility
    that the IETF can have profound impact on the course of OSI
    protocols.
    Chapin summarized the possibilities in the following diagram:



                                 |

      _______                    |

     |  TCP  |---------------------->

     |_______|         |         |

                 ______|____     |

                |"new stuff"|    |  "Future"

                |___________|    |

                       |         |

      _______          V         |

     |  OSI  |---------------------->

     |_______|                   |



 3.11 Steve Kent

Kent offered ideas on the internet security architecture.

 1. Do we put security in only the endpoints? "Hosts will always be
    the best defense or the weakest link".
 2. Site administrators erect perimeter defenses; architecture needs
    to include them. Now that hosts are being managed by users,
    managers are increasingly unable to administer individual
    computers, so they use using perimeter defense.
 3. Need both end security services and also some functions in
    intermediate system, e.g., accounting and billing.
 4. Security is ultimately linked to routing and addressing.
 5. He dislikes application level relays, and there are also some
    security problems. Where does security go in the protocol stack?
    In the application there is too much duplication, and presentation
    syntax is a problem if security is in the applications.
 6. Global authentication would be a Good Thing.

  4. WRAP-UP

Clark led a final high-level wrap up. He saw three alternative
    futures:

 1. Relays dominate the world. X.400 becomes the only ubiquitous
    protocol, while IP/CLNP are used only locally. X.400 and X.500
    become generalized to accommodate other applications.
    Clark rejects this as the "only" solution.
 2. Commercial carriers dominate. Routing is handled entirely inside
    the common carriers; this is the "Cheriton Conjecture".
    We must accept this as an ultimate possibility.
 3. Heterogeneity dominates. Can it be global?

The group felt a need to build a future that accommodates these
diverse visions, even if the complex solution ends up not being
needed. The IAB is in a position to influence the future, and should
work towards the preferable outcomes.

The IAB felt that vision 1 is a nightmare. However, it will exist to a
limited extent, so application level gateways should be architected
into the system. Vision 2 is a possibility the IAB must deal with.
Vision 3 is the most general, and constitutes the basis for a plan.

Further discussion is needed, and the IAB planned an "architectural
summit". There was lots of interest in an architecture summit.
Participation will be limited to the IAB and IESG and all participants
should come prepared with papers. This is tentatively scheduled for
June 11-13, 1991.

Slide 3

                      SOME CLAIMS -- MY POSITION

We have two different goals:
  * Make it possible to build "The Internet"
  * Define a protocol suite called Internet

Claim: These goals have very different implications. The protocols are
but a means, though a powerful one.

Claim: If "The Internet" is to succeed and grow, it will require
specific design efforts. This need will continue for at least another
10 years.

Claim: Uncontrolled growth could lead to chaos.

Claim: A grass-roots solution seems to be the only means to success.
Top-down mandates are powerless.

End node or network? Routers or relays?
  _________________________________________________________________

Slide 6

                     BOUNDING THE SOLUTION SPACE

How far can we migrate from the current state?
  * Can we change the IP header (except to OSI)?
  * Can we change host requirements in mandatory ways?
  * Can we manage a long-term migration objective? - Consistent
    direction vs. diverse goals, funding.

Can we assume network-level connectivity?
  * Relays are the wave of the future (?)
  * Security a key issue; along with conversion.
  * Do we need a new "relay-based" architecture?

How "managed" can/must "The Internet" be?
  * Can we mandage or constrain connectivity?

What protocols are we working with? One or many?
  _________________________________________________________________

Slide 7

                     THE MULTI-PROTOCOL INTERNET

"Making the problem harder for the good of mankind."

Are we migrating, interoperating, or tolerating multiple protocols?
  * Not all protocol suites will have same range of functionality at
    the same time.
  * "The Internet" will require specific functions.

Claim: Fundamental conflict (not religion or spite):
  * Meeting aggressive requirements for the Internet
  * Dealing with OSI migration.

Conclusion: One protocol must "lead", and the others must follow.
When do we "switch" to OSI?
Consider every following slide in this context

  * How do addresses and routes relate?
  * What is the model of topology?
  * What solutions are possible?

What range of policy routing is required?
  * BGP and IDRP are two answers. What is the question?
  * Fixed classes, or variable paths?
  * Source controlled routing is a minimum.

How seamless is the needed support for mobile hosts?

Slide 10

                      DEALING WITH DIVERSTITURE

The Internet is composed of parts separately managed and controlled.

What support is needed for network charging?
  * No architecture implies bulk charges and re-billing, pay for lost
    packets.
  * Do we need controls to supply billing id or routing?

Requirement: we must support links with controlled sharing. (Simple
form is classes based on link id.)

                               SECURITY

Can we persist in claiming the end-node is the only line of defense?
  * What can we do inside the network?
  * What can ask the host to do?

Do we tolerate relays, or architect them?
Can find a better way to construct security boundaries? Do we need
global authentication?

Do we need new host requirements:
  * Logging.
  * Authentication.
  * Management interfaces.
       + Phone number or point of reference.
