ISOC Signs Contract for RFC Editor

Since the U.S. government ceased funding IANA, ISOC has 
been funding the RFC Editor function for the IETF. We have had a 
one-year contract with the University of Southern 
California from 1 October 1998; we signed an extension until we could 
complete a three-year contract effective 1 October 1999 
through 30 September 2002. This a major additional 
commitment of ISOC to the IETF ($1,295,517) another we are 
happy to provide.
