So, IDs could be as valuable as RFCs.
Then, why imposing a 6 month limit for IDs, when diskspace is so
cheap?

The reason for ID disappearance has nothing to do with space.

The IDs are deliberately ephemeral, intended to foster the open exchange 
of partial ideas. Establishing them as archival from the start imposes a 
hurdle that was percieved to inhibit this exchange.

Some ideas do fall by the wayside, ideas which could have been archived 
as Informational RFCs, technical reports, or published papers. In cases 
where that has not been done, it was the authors' choice not to pursue 
that route.

FYI...

You're right, but having a repository of the old drafts means saving 
almost all the (good or bad) Internet research in a much more 
complete manner than archiving the RFCs.

IDs could be tagged as "WORK IN PROGRESS" and shifted to "HISTORICAL" 
once they expire after 6 months; these drafts could be saved into two 
different directories.

I have a private collection of the drafts published in the last 
years: looking at the evolution of a protocol (e.g. CIDR) is a very 
useful exercise.

BTW:
Does the copyright prevent a site from allowng the access to old IDs 
? Does a (non-official) repository of old drafts exist in the 
Internet?

What this and several followups ignores is the impact on the authors.

Authors will cease to present partially-complete ideas. There will be 
fewer work-in-progress drafts. There will, in summary, be less of this 
'good or bad' research to preserve.

Once the IDs become archival, they end up being an undistinguished tech 
report series. We already have them - all over the place.

The thing that makes IDs unique is _exactly_ the fact that they are NOT 
archived. Were that property to disappear, there would be a void.

Consider the impact on the stream of published information, as well as 
the fact that there are already other ways to publish archival information.

Yes, but the process becomes increasingly formalised - originally RFCs
were informal and barriers to publication were low. Now RFCs are
formal and the draft process formalises the documents while rasising
the barrier to publication as an RFC.

I've increasingly seen draft deltas go to a small off-WG audience
before popping up when submitted as an 'official' draft just before a
meet closing deadline; I'm not sure that this is good, since it limits
on-list discussion before the meet.

I'm worried that the process will even become more formal still, if:

http://ftp.ietf.org/iesg/iesg.2002-12-12
IP     o Thomas to write (or cause to be written) a draft on "how to
         get to Draft"

is anything to go by.

oh, wait. Do they mean 'Draft Standard'? Stupid namespace collision.

I'm not clear that the two are related. There are few barriers to 
putting out an ID, except timing. Due to the manual processing 
requirements and the desire for a modicum of sanity checking, it's 
infeasible to handle the burst of submissions before each IETF meeting 
without including a buffer period.

This is the reason that many IDs submitted just before the deadline are 
concurrently posted to newsgroups; it allows open discussion while 
waiting for the burst to be processed. I agree that this isn't optimal - 
IMO, any idea that isn't sufficiently solid a few weeks before the IETF 
isn't sufficiently solid to warrant burning the $$ of people's time 
discussing it ;-)

It's generally useful to help people design drafts in a way that reduces 
the repeated feedback from the RFC Editor. Most venues have some 
publication guidelines; it's not clear they're aiming at formalizing the 
process so much as providing editorial structure.

This is not the case and has not been the case with other groups. 
You can most other standards groups and find written contributions 
suggesting changes to all or part of a draft under development along 
with rationale as to why the change should be made.  In some groups, 
you will even find a written record of how each comment or 
contribution on a document underdeveloped was dealt with and why.

I have not noticed that the fact this material is available in the 
group's paper trail has any effect on the amount or quality of the 
contributions.

Depends on how they are dealt with.

No the problem we have is there is a void.  To modify an old adage, 
those who can not know history are doomed to repeat it.  Actually now 
that you mention it that may explain alot.

There are some people (myself included) who will cease to publish 
drafts. That decreases (by definition) the set of what is published; to 
the extent that others care, it will further decrease that set.

That's nearly impossible to measure. We have no series that was 
explicitly not archived then archived to compare. All we have are 
different communities right now.

There always was, and continues to be a path for publication that some 
draft authors have chosen and others have not. Draft authors can always 
submit documents for Informational RFC; some have, others have not. 
Although there are some submissions which have been rejected (every 
system has its minimum standards), overall we already have a solution to 
this problem, and it doesn't involve archiving all drafts for historical 
purposes.

I agree that the world is less informed by not having the intermediate 
forms of "the Shining", e.g. That is as it has been - the choice of the 
author. All we do by archiving drafts is to take the ephemeral track away.

That is more because for some Orwellian reason Requests for Comments 
became Standards and Internet Draft (which sounds like a preliminary 
standard) become comments.  But we have hashed that issue before 
elsewhere.  It is still pretty informal.

But it is typical behavior as committees age, the participation 
broadens, and people participating are playing their own agendas. 
This one of the oldest games in the book.

My experience is that formality creeps in primarily as the process is 
abused.  The more it is abused the more necessary it is to make rules 
about things where it could be assumed that good and fair behavior 
would prevail.  As the stakes increase, that becomes less the case. 
The only way for it not to happen is to work on things that few 
people care about!  Either because they don't know it is important or 
because it isn't!

The long-term history of ideas is hurt by the non-preservation of ID's, 
etc.   The ideas had influence, almost certainly, even if they turned out 
to be weak or "wrong".

One of the problems with scientific progress is the lack of documentation 
of experiments that didn't pan out, because the authors are presumed to 
have "failed" and want to avoid embarrassment.

Most of us, if we are honest, have learned far more from making mistakes 
and debugging them.  Why then, do we refuse to pass on our hard-won 
knowledge?   This is not because of science, but because of ego-driven fear.

	I absolutely agree with this thread (Rahmat/David/Simone's comments)
	on preserving IDs to record the evolution of design, i.e. our
	history.  The "path" can be more interesting than the "end result". 

	Since my focus (this last year ) has been on the early Arpanet 
	design issues, I have been aided by the abundance of RFCs which discuss
	a specific design.  (of course, I still wish that more minutes of the
	design meetings were preserved   -- if anyone has any non-published
	minutes 1969-1974 please let me know ....;-)

	of both of the following: 
		* today's Internet Drafts, and 
		* email: some of the early RFCs would today just have been

	While current IETF working groups seem to be great about archiving
	email, a similar issue of lost resources seems to be occurring when 
	working groups conclude.   At this point, no email archive is linked 
	into the IETF web pages that describe the work of the concluded

I agree that archiving mail that was archived to begin with would be 
useful. I'm opposed to archiving intermediate process when the authors 
explicitly chose to provide a non-archival form.

If authors want to archive their results, they are free to publish them 
in more conventional venues, even in their intermediate form.

When someone says "this is off the record" it is off the record. That's 
what IDs are, very explicitly.

[Geoff Huston]

>The thing that makes IDs unique is _exactly_ the fact that they are NOT 
>archived. Were that property to disappear, there would be a void.

This is a curious claim in so far as they _are_ archived,  all over 
the world in thousands of locations. There is no concept in today's 
world of being able to 'unpublish" anything, or to be able to 
withdraw a document from the online public space. IETF meeting 
proceedings publish and archive the drafts used by the WGs at 
the time. Google has more than an significant number of hits for 
expired drafts, and so on.

Regardless of the merits of Joe's arguments, and I must admit that 
there is considerable merit in his view of the role of drafts, the 
harsh reality is that these documents do not and will not disappear 
from public availability. Accordingly, It makes more sense
to me to recognize and work within the  characteristics and 
properties of the world we live in than to insist that somehow 
something that is happening should not happen and that we should 
behave as if it is not happening.

But this is well beyond Internet History and I will not post further 
on this topic to this mailer.  My apologies for the diversion.

regards,

   Geoff

Agreed. Though personal use archives are different from "available for 
others publicly", at least according to copyright law.

And, as Geoff and I have discussed elswhere, there are those of us who 
are glad to educate those who illegally post documents for which they do 
not hold copyright.

I.e., that there are archives and they are public does not make them 
either legal or appropriate.

The world we live in includes many things that are illegal and/or 
inappropriate. I hope we strive to rise above and/or correct those 
things, rather than admit defeat per se.

This claim raises two issues:

1. The assertion that "authors will cease..." unless things they write are 
deleted from institutional memory (or at least not actively preserved) is 
falsifiable by straightforward experimental evidence.  There is no need to 
claim it without proof.   It does indeed remind me of the idea that the 
POTUS and his office should be immune from sunlight in their contacts with 
lobbyists, etc. lest those lobbyists be unwilling to share their true views.

2. Shouldn't the authors be given the choice to preserve in an archival 
form their thoughts, along with all other IDs, etc. in such a way that 
makes it much less work for historians and students of design options to 
understand old proposals?

There are IDs which authors chose not to publish as RFCs or as tech 
reports elsewhere.

Thus concludes the contradiction of the falsification. By those 
examples, removing all documents that authors never intended for 
archival publication reduces the set of IDs.

They are - Informational RFCs. Note that not all IDs went that route. 
Again, proof by example.

IMO, the authors should continue to be given the choice they already 
have - NOT to publish archivally. They already have the alternate choice 
in spades.

Fair use is explicitly part of copyright law.   History is clearly a policy 
goal of fair use.   IANAL, but I would expect that there is precedent 
protecting people who share personal archives of documents for the purpose 
of historical research.

Just a reminder from someone dedicated to educating people that copyright 
includes rights of fair use, as well as other exceptions.   Electronic 
rights are complex, as well.  The Internet crosses jurisdictions, and 
documents such as IDs are published in many locations at once, so the right 
to "unpublish" is determined by jurisdiction.

IMO, standing behind copyright really distorts the issue of desirable 
dissemination of knowledge and scientific knowledge, in particular.

I cannot provide you with a photographic copy of copyrighted material 
without the permission of the publisher. You can make one for yourself, 
but you cannot distribute it. That precedent already exists for paper 
works. IANAL either, but I would expect that this is a reasonable 
analog, and that regardless of the "public good" of distributing those 
copies "for historical purposes," it would still be a blatent violation 
of copyright law.

"unpublish" is a bit misleading. When IDs are published, they are 
distributed by the IETF by authority of the author under explicit 
time-limited terms. Once those terms cease, (again, IANAL), it seems 
that further public distribution constitutes continued "publication", 
and would be a violation of copyright law.

I cannot remove it from everyone's personal archives, but I believe I 
can prevent anyone from passing it on to anyone else, whether posting it 
for the 'public good' or otherwise.

Doing things that violate private rights for the "public good," despite 
the current fashion, are detestable.

You're posting angry again, Joe. :-)

That statement is false on its face (and I think your earlier statements
about your rights to stop publication were also a little too sweeping).
Most laws are about balancing public goods and private rights, and I
know you know it.  My private right to free speech is violated in
crowded movie houses all over the country for the public good of
avoiding mass tramplings.

Maybe you'd like to unpublish this one. :-)

Fair use is deep water with dangerous currents.  I'm not a lawyer,
either, but I wouldn't try to assert a fair use claim in the face of
opposition without one either.

I'd want to see that precedent before I'd rely on there being one.  More
to the point, I'd want my laywer to see that precedent.

Keeping a private collection of documents and allowing specific people
access to them for historical puproses is one thing, making a collection
of documents publically available is another.  Anything intended to be
detected by Google feels more like the former than the latter to me.
The UCLA film library can't start showing their copyrighted films to the
general public on a regular basis no matter how noble or scholarly their
intent.

It's not at all clear to me that the idea of unpublishing has been
legally tested.  I don't know if there's any legal precedent at all.
For all I know, the very idea of unpublishing something may well be a
nonsense idea in the legal world.  I'd love to see a relevant legal
citation.

I'm just worrying about the US system, though you are correct that the
Internet situation is even more complex.

Perhaps, but cranky ID authors are not the primary problem in this
regard.  Many conferences and journals also enforce copyright on
scientific knowledge.

More practically, if people are concerned about keeping the majority of
the IDs available, the simplest tack is not to futz with the lawyers,
but to get the IDs, set up a website and make them available.  When an
ID expires (a situation detectable with a perl script) mail the author
(their e-mail address is also part of the ID) and request permission to
archive the thing.  If the author says OK, you leave the copy up
(perhaps appending a notice that the expired draft appears with the
author's permission), otherwise you delete the draft.  The whole thing
can be largely automated (including the author's reply for prolific
authors).  I suspect that the negative responses would be very few.

Results: ID's (other than authors who'd be a pain about it anyway)
legally archived in the web for posterity, and I don't have to hear this
argument for the one thousand and first time.

Unpublishing isn't the issue, FWIW; the issue is permission to publish 
for a finite period of time. That's fairly common. When the granted time 
expires, the source is no longer permitted to publish.

Putting things on web servers is publishing. I never said I could erase 
things from archives, just prohibit them from being put on web servers 
everyone could access.

As to balancing public good, I agree. I said _violate_, not balance.

Somehow I doubt that ;-)  but statistically I think you would find 
that the number who would not submit contributions would be 
insignificant.  And since no one person's ideas are so important that 
the rest can not get on without them, it is doubtful they would be 
missed.  This effort is not personal, it is stochastic.

Actually, not true.  If you look at IEEE, T1, ISO, ITU, ANSI, ABA, 
IEC, and many other groups you will find that such paper trails exist 
and perhaps not readily available they are available.

This is not at all the case.  Science is a much different process 
than writing a novel.  The exploration of the domain of inquiry and 
the process by which it takes place is as important as the final 
answer.  More often than not the process may provide more 
understanding for the next problem than the answer ever will.

Take care,

That is not a metric. You are not citing groups that changed policies; 
they were archival from the start. Agreed that they have open exchange, 
but by design.

That may be the case, but it is the authors' decision, absent a-priori 
arrangements of a forum (e.g., this forum is archived, and that is known 
by participants when they sign-up).

IDs are a place where exploration comes without the threat of persistent 
archives of proposals, _by design_. As mentioned before, there are 
plenty of other archival forums, including RFCs themselves.

 From my research into the early institution-building of Internet 
standards (ICCB, IAB, IETF), it seems that another reason for 
building in formality is to allow open participation. As 
participation and interest grow, so too must the governing 
structures.  The history of ICCB, IAB, and IETF suggests that this 
sort of scalable governance was a key to the growth of the Internet - 
I've got a work-in-progress on some of this political and cultural 
history, a paper is available from   http://aconcept51.com/arussell/. 
I would love to hear comments, stories, etc if anyone's interested in 
contributing.

As for historians using Internet Drafts - anyone faithful to the 
Guidelines for Internet Drafts 
ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1id-guidelines.txt will note that the first 
paragraph states:  "These documents should not be cited or quoted in 
any formal document."  That's pretty clear.  On the surface, I don't 
see any harm in looking up an old ID in a personal archive or on 
google, especially if it helps the thinking process.  We'll know 
things are getting out of hand when the lawyers come in and the IETF 
begins a RIAA-style crackdown on distribution of old IDs....

I don't see how formality allows open participation.  Generally, the 
minimal number of rules is best and then only to ensure fair 
participation.  My experience has been that the number of rules and 
the formality of the process increases either when fairness is abused 
or one group attempts to maintain control of the process.  The first 
is a case where without written rules some try to use the fact that 
"there is no rule that says I can't" to abuse a fair and reasonable 
process.

Initially there were very few if any written rules.  My understanding 
is that the rules in place came about when it became clear that the 
IETF/IESG/IAB etc.  needed to be able to ensure that a process was 
followed that would not subject it to law suits or claims of 
anti-trust behavior.  The process was and always has been about as 
open as you can get without formality.  Frankly, I think the current 
process is so open that it provides the perfect disguise for 
manipulation by anyone with the resources to play the game.

Take care,
John

In this case I would think that the creation of rules is a healthy 
development for preserving a fair and reasonable process.

More formal structures allow a body to move away from a small 
"council of elders," thus making leadership somewhat accountable to 
the participants. Comparatively, the IETF has a minimum of rules and 
institutional structures; but those rules keep the process 
consistent, and therefore make the IETF more reliable as an 
institution. Without formal rules, a small group of people could make 
decisions that don't have broad support (such as was alleged of the 
IAB with CLNP in 1992). It's a classic constitution-building question 
- how much authority and structure is needed to preserve freedom? Is 
it too easy to manipulate the system?

There are two separate threads that I have promoted:

	1) that the rules cannot be changed retroactively
	2) that the current rules are desirable and provide
	the characteristic uniqueness of the ID series,
	and should be preserved.

I accept that authors do, will, and have always had the chance to opt-in 
to a public archive. Perhaps paradoxically, I have vigorously defended 
my right to refuse permission to others to post my prior IDs (at least 
the ones that I was primary author on), but continue to serve some on my 
own website and have offered them without hesitation to individuals who 
requested them.

The ID "RFC" 'rules' state only that the IETF assures that it will serve 
the drafts for 6 months, and that they are not to be cited as other than 
work in progress.

Authors could always declare their works in the public domain, thus 
allowing anyone to serve them. It's simple - something akin to "Right is 
hereby granted, in perpituity, for non-profit use and disemmination of 
this document."

I have issue only that this not be required as a condition of 
publication of IDs, to ensure that the past character of the IDs as 
ephemeral (when desired, as always) is retained.

Copyright exists ONLY for the public good.   If it fails to improve the 
public good, and serves only private interests, the Government should no 
longer provide it.  It's not a natural law, it is merely a synthetic 
construct, constructed and enforced by the Government.

There are no "private rights" to transmit information to others, but then 
constrain what they do with it.

The most interesting analogy is in the patent law.   Once you share an 
invention with others, you lose the right to exclude, unless you use 
patents, in which case you gain a purely synthetic right for a very limited 
time, crafted entirely because of a public good argument.
