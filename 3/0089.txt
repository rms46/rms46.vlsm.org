  THE NEW WORLD ORDER

     The November 1992 IETF meeting adopted the outline of a new
     organizational structure for the IAB/IETF, to accomodate continued
     growth and new consituencies.  This outline was documented in RFC-
     1396 ["The Process for Organization of Internet Standards Working
     Group (POISED)", S. Crocker, RFC-1396, January 1993].  The Board of
     Trustees of the Internet Society accepted the revisions in December
     1992, and transition to the new plan began.

     One of the key effects of this change (known colloquially as the
     "New World Order" or NWO) is to install a nominations process to
     select new IAB and IESG members.  IAB and IESG members will serve 2
     year terms, with half of the positions on each board subject to
     re-selection each year.  The Internet Society Board of Trustees
     will review and ratify the new IAB nominations, and the IAB will
     review and ratify the new IESG nominations.

     Following the November IETF meeting, a Nomination Committee was
     selected by a random drawing from volunteering IETF attendees.
     Jeff Case served as the chair. Roughly half of the existing members
     of the IAB and IESG put their positions up for renomination; the
     other half will continue to serve with a remaining term of one
     year.

     At the Thursday evening open plenary session of the IETF meeting in
     Columbus Ohio, the Nomination Committee reported its results.  The
     "old" IAB was able to caucus in person and by telephone, and
     approved the new IESG nominations.  The ISOC Board of Trustees was
     able to approve the new IAB members via email.  Hence, the NWO is
     now fully in effect.
