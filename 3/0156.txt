``We're not in the business of saying what can and can not
be published.'' ---Frank Kastenholz, 26 February 1996

I have a one-page document that I'd like to make available as an RFC.
The IESG has asked the RFC editors not to publish this document. Here's
the complete IESG statement:

> The IESG requests draft-bernstein-hcmssc-00.txt not be published at
> this time. There is an competing proposal, and the IETF wants to
> review both. The author will be invited to work with the IETF.

Here's the chronology:

19960406 I ask the RFC editors to start the IESG review of my draft.
19960408 Joyce writes back: ``Okay. No problem.''
19960426 No news. I ask if we can proceed with the RFC publication.
19960506 No response from the RFC editors. I ask for a status report.
19960516 No response from the RFC editors. I ask for a status report.
19960517 Joyce tells me that she has sent the document to IESG.
19960529 IESG asks the RFC editors for an extension.
19960611 IESG sends its ``request'' to the RFC editors.

I've attached a copy of the document for your convenience.

The Hash Convention For Mail System Status Codes (HCMSSC)

Status of this memo

This memo defines an experimental protocol for the Internet
community. This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any
kind. Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested.
Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

1. Introduction

RFC 1893 defines codes for mail delivery failures. For example,
code 5.1.1 means that the specified mailbox does not exist.

This document proposes to spray these codes all over the place,
by adding a code to the end of the text of every error message,
preceded by a hash mark and surrounded by parentheses.

2. Examples

Here is a typical HCMSSC SMTP error message:

421 load average too high, please come back later (#4.3.2)

Here is part of a typical HCMSSC bounce message:

<mail-loop@silverton.berkeley.edu>:
This is looping; it already has my Delivered-To line. (#5.7.1)

But don't use HCMSSC when you repeat another MTA's error message:

<foo@heaven.af.mil>:
127.3.4.5 does not like recipient.
Remote host said: 550 <foo>... User unknown (#5.1.1)

3. Security considerations

Don't take drastic action upon seeing "(#"; it might not be HCMSSC.
