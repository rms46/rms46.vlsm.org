NomCom Chair -- 18 January 1993 -- IETF-Announce
------------------------------------------------

IESG/IAB Nominations Committee


As you should have already seen in a note from Vint Cerf, I am now
serving as the chair of the IAB and IESG Nominations Committee.  One of
my first responsibilities is to staff the committee, randomly selecting
the seven members from a pool of individuals meeting the guidelines set
forth by the POISED Working Group.

Consequently, we need a pool.  Vint started the process on January 8th
and I have received the list of those who responded to that call.
However, the pool is still too small.  I am therefore extending the
deadline for you to volunteer to be a part of the pool.  This means
that if you have attended at least two IETF plenary meetings and are
willing to work on this task over the next 4-6 weeks, then you should
send a mailgram to me at

        ietfnom@cs.utk.edu

stating that you are interested in serving.  Do it now -- if you are
like me, you'll forget if you put it off again.

There are at least two good reasons why you should give serious
consideration to this call for volunteers.  First, it is a civic
responsibility -- some of us must make investments in the system if it
is going to be successful.  Second, failure to volunteer should result
in forfeiture of your right to complain about any results not to your
liking.  No matter what your motivation is, if you'll be willing to
serve, I'll do my best to keep this task from being onerous.

Thanks in advance for your willingness to volunteer.


Jeff Case
IAB and IESG Nominations Committee Chair
