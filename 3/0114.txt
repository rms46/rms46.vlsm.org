Nominating Committee Chairman Selected



Folks,

I am pleased (and relieved) to report that Jeff Case has agreed
to serve as the chair of the IAB and IESG Nominations Committee.
He will undertake to organize this effort in accordance with the
recommendations of the POISED working group and in the context of
my earlier message on this subject.

The IAB and IESG positions carry great responsibility so I
want to impress on the nominations committee the necessity
for care in the conduct of their work. Discussions about
potential candidates and evaluation of their suitability to
hold office must be kept private. This is simple, professional
courtesy. I have impressed this view on Jeff and trust him to convey 
the same to the voting and advisory members of the committee.

Each of you should be giving thought to the needs of the IAB,
IETF and Internet Society and should make known to the committee
suggestions you may have as to candidates.

I will send copies of all volunteer applications I have received
thus far to Jeff for further processing.

Jeff will be advising you shortly what email address to send
further correspondence to. Please give him your best support
in carrying out this important task.

Vint
