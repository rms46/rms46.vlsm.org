                          Domain Servers Available

Hi. Yes, three instances of a Domain Server are up and running. They
are on SRI-NIC.ARPA, USC-ISIB.ARPA, and USC-ISIF.ARPA. These are TOPS-20
systems, the implementation is written in pascal. We are most interested
in having people write resolvers and test against these servers. If you
do plan to write some code please check in with Paul Mockapetris at ISI to
get the details of some small differences from the initial specifications
(RFCs 882 & 883). Paul is (RFCs 882 & 883). Paul is
MOCKAPETRIS@USC-ISIF.ARPA. A revised spec is
planned soon.

Work is also under way on a new implementation schedule for putting the
full domain name system into use. That schedule should also appear
in the next few weeks.
