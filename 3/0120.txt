NOTE: Some of you may have already received this message, but many did
      not due to our mailer encountering a problem requiring retransmission.
      My apologies for any problems this may cause.
===========================================================================

I have been asked to address two questions about the pool of volunteers for
staffing the IAB/IESG Nominations Committee for 1993.

1.  Q:  How many names were in the pool?
    A:  33 plus or minus.  I say plus or minus because there were 4 names in
        the pool that would have required extra attention.  One was
        questionable with respect to the attendance criteria -- the resolution
        of differences between their recollections and the Secretariat's
        attendance records was not completed before the appointed time for the
        drawing.  Three others volunteered after the deadline -- just before
        the drawing.  I placed these names "into the hat" (actually a basket)
        for the drawing, postponing any difficult decisions about the correct
        way to handle these exceptional cases.  My life was made easier when
        none of these four were drawn thereby avoiding the need to make any
        difficult decisions or to seek guidance from others.

2.  Q:  Why are there no women on the committee?
    A:  Answering this is as easy as gettin' up after sittin' down on a thumb
        tack.
        Only one woman volunteered to serve.  Over 30 men volunteered to
        serve.
        Seven names were drawn, and they were all men, which is
        probabilistically correct, even if it is not politically correct.
