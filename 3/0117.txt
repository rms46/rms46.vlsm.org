IAB/IESG Nominations Committee status
report and final volunteer call


The list of volunteers to serve of the IAB/IESG nominations committee has been
shaping up nicely.  Thanks to all who have volunteered thus far.

I have been holding the period to receive additional volunteers open until
the first of the week because private e-mail tells me that we may pick up a
bit more European representation for the pool of names if we do so.  However,
we do need to get started on our work, so this is your last chance:  any
additional volunteers should identify themselves by sending email to 
ietfnom@cs.utk.edu to be received by the close of business (east coast USA
time) on Monday Jan 25th.  We'll let everyone know the results of the random
selection later in the week.

Anyone who is interested in serving should be willing to spend about 5 hours
per week for about 4-6 weeks (these are only estimates -- your mileage may vary)
and should have attended at least two IETF plenaries.

Each person who thinks they volunteered should have received a confirmation --
if you volunteered and if you have not received a confirmation, please contact
me.


regards,
jdc
