IAB/IESG Nominations Needed


According to Steve Coya, the following IAB members are up for renewal:

Bob Braden
+ Christian Huitema
+ Steve Kent
+ Barry Leiner
+ Tony Lauck
Jon Postel

According to same, the following IESG slots are up for selection:

+ Erik Huizer Applications
Dave Piscitello Internet
Open * Operations
+ Bob Hinden Routing
+ Steve Crocker Security
+ Joyce Reynolds User Services

I haven't gotten all the answers back from the IESG (hence the noticable
delay in this posting), but to my knowledge all of the above are interested
in renewing their committments with the exception of Bob Braden, Jon
Postel, and Dave Piscitello.

The first order of business for the nominating committee is then:

of those who wish to renew, whom do we accept?

Those in the community who have strong opinions and weighty evidence should
post it to the headhunt@nri.reston.va.us list. Note that I'm not looking
here for "gee, I think he's a nice guy" or for flames; I'm looking for
strong reasons that the person should or should not continue in office.

The second order of business (and with respect to at least four positions,
a very valid activity to get started on) is:

whom shall we nominate to fill the positions that are vacant or which
we make vacant?

Those in the community who feel that a person is eminently qualified to
fill an open position, either on the IAB or the IESG, should post that
person's qualifications to the headhunt@ietf.cnri.reston.va.us list. Please
do us a favor: check with the person first, and if possible convince
him/her to make the posting.

<From here on out, I am expecting to make few ietf@cnri postings on this
subject; the matter will continue on the headhunt@cnri list.
