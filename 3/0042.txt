Loss and continuity 

IETF,

The IAB is saddened and devastated by the loss of our dear friend
and colleague Jon Postel. We will help to ensure that his memory
is not forgotten and that his legacy prospers.

Meanwhile, we wish to reassure you that the IANA and RFC Editor
services continue to run smoothly and stably, as they have for
many years, with their current staff.  

    Brian Carpenter (IAB Chair)
