NomCom -- 15 March 1999 -- IETF-Announce
----------------------------------------

NOMCOM IAB Results 

This year, over 45 persons were suggested to the nominations committee
and considered for the IAB.  Many would have been excellent choices
and it was hard to narrow it down to the number of openings available.

The nominations committee is pleased to announce that the following
slate has been nominated and confirmed for the open positions on the
Internet Architecture Board.  They take their seats at the end of the
IETF meeting next week in Minneapolis.  All are for regular two year
terms.

        Harald Alvestrand
        Ran Atkinson
        Rob Austein
        Steve Deering
        Tony Hain
        Geoff Huston

Thanks,
Donald, chair, 1998-1999 nomcom
