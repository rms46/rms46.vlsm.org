Dear Internauts:

A number of positions on the IAB and IESG are now open and
are to be filled for the 1993-1994 period by the nominations 
committee, led by Jeff Case. As you know, we are trying a new 
process for filling these positions and I am grateful to IAB 
and IESG members who volunteered their positions for this 
initial round of renewal and to Jeff Case and his committee
for their commitment. All appointments are for two years of 
service.
