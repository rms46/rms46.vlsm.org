        IAB statement on US Government White Paper

The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) has reviewed the US Government
White Paper at

http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/6_5_98dns.htm

and welcomes it, especially the emphasis on self-governance 
for the Internet. In our view it is rather urgent to build 
international consensus around the new IANA corporation, and 
the IAB will strive to do so as quickly as possible. In particular,
the IAB believes that the new corporation must be built out 
from the existing IANA function hosted by the Information Sciences
Institute of the University of Southern California under the 
direction of Jon Postel.

The IAB is an oversight committee of the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF). For further details, please see the Web site
