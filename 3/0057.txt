Abel Weinrib expressed his desire to step down. We received 
twenty excellent nominations by the closing date of April 15, 
and had considerable diffculty choosing among those nominees 
willing to serve. After careful discussion, the IAB is pleased 
to announce the appointment of 

            Erik Huizer

his years of service, to thank the unsuccessful candidates
for their willingness to serve, and to wish Erik every success.
