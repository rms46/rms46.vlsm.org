NomCom Chair -- 12 October 1998 -- IETF-Announce
------------------------------------------------

Nomcom Volunteer Pool and Selection Algorithm 


42 persons volunteered to be in the pool from which the IETF Nomcom is
to be selected and 41 of these were found to be eligible under the
criteria in RFC 2282.  They are announced below.  If you think you
should be on this list as an eligible volunteer but are not, contact
me immediately.  The list will be frozen at midnight, Wednesday,
October 14th.  Selection of the 10 voting nomcom members will be via
the algorithm specified in draft-eastlake-selection-00.txt with inputs
of (1) the closing price of IBM (NYSE-IBM) stock on Oct. 16th, (2) all
seven Massachusetts State Lottery MassMillions numbers for Thursday,
Oct 15, (3) the closing price of CyberCash (NASDAQ-CYCH) stock on Oct
16th, (4) the Massachusetts State Lottery Daily Number for Oct 16th
treated as a single four digit integer, and (5) the closing price of
Compaq (NYSE-CPQ) stock on Oct 16h.  Anyone should be able to
duplicate the selection calculation.  On Oct. 18th, I will announce
those I believe to be selected.  Any questions as to the input values
used or the faithful execution of the algorithm must get to me by
midnight, October 20th.

The right mailing list for discussions of these matters is
<poised@tis.com>.

Thanks,
Donald

(Although information on the volunteers below is probably no big
secret, as a comrpomise between better identifying the volunteers and
providing excess information, I have listed only their names and the
last two labels in the domain name portion of their email address.)
