the namedroppers list policy


                        NAMEDROPPERS POLICY 

Scope: 

This NAMEDROPPERS mailing list is to be used for discussion of the 
concepts, principles, design, and implementation of the domain style 
names. The main focus of this group is the review of documents 
describing domain style name system (currently RFCs 882, 883, 973, 974) 
and discussion of the implementation of the system. 

The scope is limited to the technical aspects of the system. It does 
not include discussion of the actual names selected, or the semantics of 
those names. There are other forums for those discussions (for example, 
HEADER-PEOPLE, and ARPA-MHS). 

Policy: 

While one of the advantages of computer mail and mailing lists 
mechanisms is fast response, in this list we prefer to go a little slow 
to ensure thoughtful discussion. In general, one should let some time 
go by (a day) between first reading a message and composing a response. 
Even during periods of intense activity on this list one should not send 
more than one message per day. Typically this would allow one to 
discuss several other contributions in one message. 

      * Wait a day between reading and sending. 

      * Send at most one message per day. 

On the other hand, this is a list for participants in a discussion, not 
observers. Everyone on the list is expected to contribute from time to 
time.

Related mailing lists: 

HEADER-PEOPLE 

This group is for the discussion of issues in the design and 
implementation of the Internet community Text mail system (based on RFCs 
821 and 822). Comments are welcome from any community that uses these 
conventions. This may include the interaction of the domain style names 
with the operation of this mail system. 

To get on or off HEADER-PEOPLE send your request to 
HEADER-PEOPLE-REQUEST@MIT-MC.ARPA. 

ARPA-MHS 

This group is explicitly focused on the development of means for 
interoperation and interconnection of the Internety community Text mail 
system and the international standards community X.400/MHS mail systems. 
This includes developing a mapping between the naming procedures used in 
these two systems. 

To get on or off ARPA-MHS send your request to 
ARPA-MHS-REQUEST@BRL.ARPA. 

MMM-PEOPLE 

This group is exploring the issues in multimedia computer mail (i.e., 
mail that includes text, bitmap, voice, graphics, and other special data 
types). This is based on work that has gone on for several years under 
both DARPA and NAVY sponsorship. There is consideration in this group 
of the use of X.400/MHS as a basis for further work on multimedia mail. 

To get on or off MMM-PEOPLE send your request to 
MMM-PEOPLE-REQUEST@C.ISI.EDU. 

Multiple Addresses: 

Nearly everyone in NAMEDROPPERS is also on HEADER-PEOPLE. There is no 
need to send a message to both NAMEDROPPERS and any other list. 

People are pretty careful about which lists they are and are not on. It 
is really best to send your message to exactly one list. If it was the 
wrong one, someone will let you know. Sending a message to more than 
one list will surely waste a significant amount of both computer and 
people time and resources. 

In fact, when sending to NAMEDROPPERS the only address needed is 
NAMEDROPPERS@SRI-NIC.ARPA. If you are responding to a particular 
comment by someone he or she will get the message without being 
explicitly addressed, and you will get a copy back too. 

History: 

All of the previous discussion of the NAMEDROPPERS can be found in the 
files 

      <NAMSER>NAMEDROPPERS.YYYY on SRI-NIC.ARPA, 

where YYYY is the year. There are currently files for 1983, 1984, and 
1985. <NAMSER>NAMEDROPPERS.MAIL contains the most current
NAMEDROPPERS dialog. These files can be accessed via anonymous FTP. 
New member of NAMEDROPPERS may which to copy and read these archives 
before joining the discussion.
