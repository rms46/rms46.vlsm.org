Establishment of the 1995 IAB/IESG -- Nominations Committee


Folks,

I am pleased to report that members of the 1995 IAB/IESG Nominations
Committee have been selected. I received 30 volunteers for a total of 
ten positions on the nominating committee and the Rev. Charles Hume of 
the Mansfield Congregational Church drew forth 10 names by random drawing.

The resulting Nominations Committee membership is as follows:

Marshall Rose 
Fred Baker
Tony Genovese 
Paul Traina
Roxana Bradescu 
Greg Ruth 
Peter S. Ford
Michael Mealling 
Steven Waldbusser 
Charlie Perkins 

The Nominations Committee will also have several non-voting liaisons from 
the IESG, the IAB, the IRSG, and the ISOC Trustees. Jon Postel will serve 
as the IRSG liaison, and other liaisons are being assigned at this time.
All commitee members may be reached via the mailing list "nomcom@bbn.com".

An announcement of the IAB and IESG positions to be filled will be made 
shortly along with information on how to send suggestions to the committee.

Thank you,
John Curran
Chair, 1995 IAB/IESG Nominations Committee
