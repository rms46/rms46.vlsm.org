IAB/IESG Nominating Committee


As of this morning, I have 41 nominating committee volunteers and two
liason contacts. Of the volunteers, the POISED document (RFC 1396) says I
must draw seven names. The stochastic event will happen on Monday, January
10.

If you wish to volunteer, please drop me a note with your name, business
address, and business and home telephone and FAX numbers. You must have
attended two IETF meetings and not want a job on the IESG or the IAB.

Many have asked as to the scope of the work involved. By April at the
latest (and realistically, by March) we must propose persons to replace six
current IAB and six current IESG members. Many of the incumbents are
interested in continuing in service, but not all. I expect that somewhere
between 40 and 80 hours of effort will be asked of each nominating
committee member over the next three months.
