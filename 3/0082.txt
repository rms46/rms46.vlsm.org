IESG Chair -- 7 December 1994 -- IETF-Announce
----------------------------------------------

IESG Positions

The IESG Chair believes that the following slots are or will be vacant:

Operations: Scott Bradner
Applications: John Klensin
Internet: Stev Knowles
Transport: Allison Mankin
Net Mgmt: Marshall Rose
Standards: Lyman Chapin (resigned)

The chair wishes to thank all of these Area Directors who have served
capabably under often difficult circumstances. The IETF and IESG all owe
them a vote of thanks.

After consulting with the IESG, I would ask that the Nominations Committee
select nominees for these positions, with the exception of the Standards
Area which has no active WGs. No new areas or directors are suggested.
Standards liasions have been dispersed into the appropriate areas and WGs.

Respectfully submitted,

Paul Mockapetris
IETF and IESG Chair
