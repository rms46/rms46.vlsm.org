        Has anybody made any serious estimates of how long it will be
before we run out of 32-bit IP addresses? (Silly question; I'm sure a very
great amount of thought has been given to it by many people.) With the
proliferation of such things as diskless workstations, each of which has
its own IP address (not to mention terminal multiplexors which eat up one
IP address per tty line!), it seems like it won't be too long before we
just plain run out of addresses.

        Yes, I know that 2^32 is a hell of a big number, but it seems like
we won't get anywhere near that number of assigned addresses before we
effectively run out because most nets are sparsely populated. My little
bit of wire, for example, has 256 allocated addresses yet I'm only actually
using 30 or so.

Roy,

As you noted, the allocations are often larger than the actual host count
because of the way net numbers must be bound to a chunk of address space
in the 32 bit formats available.

We should be worried about this and should be thinking about how to expand
the available address space. Possibilities include adopting ISO IP
numbering (variable length - non-trivial), introducing a 64 bit
format (a new IP version number would probably be needed), adding
an extended address option (awkward, I suspect), others?

A quick perusal of my copy of Internet Numbers indicates that there are a
fair number of assigned addresses that are not connected to the Internet -
perhaps these addresses could be reclaimed - there is one class A, about 40
class B and I have not counted how many class C addresses that are not
connected.

This is not a long term solution, but if a crunch comes quickly then it may
be a temporary solution that would last long enough to get a proper solution

done.

Jon,

The way I read it, there are 127 possible class A nets,
16,383 class B nets, roughly 2M+ class C nets, and a
bunch (2**28 - 1) of broadcast addresses.

The large number of class C nets available should have been
sufficient, but we are experiencing some difficulty dealing
with large numbers of nets at the IP gateway level (table
and routing update sizes). Subnetting works better with
class B network format, because there is some room for subnet
and host address space. Reparsing the class C address space
might be a helpful step towards making more nets effectively
available.

Vint:

You are correct about the number of network numbers, 126 class A, 
16K class B, and 2M class C. This small address space may be come a problem 
in a few years, in the mean time is there going to be a solution to the 
routing problem so that we can have gateways that will route to more 
than 500 networks?

Ah, they said that about addresses spaces so many times...it is to
cry.

I want to see a protocol address space large enough to handle a node
in each household appliance, each piece of electronic equipment, and
several extras per household, office and vehicle. Traffic lights on
the Internet. Stray toasters. And enough addresses left over to
scatter hosts across the inner solar system.

I'm not very worried about IP running out of addresses here because
I'm pretty sure that by the time we start doing all this we'll have
learned enough new things about protocols and the devices we're
communicating with that we'll have scrapped TCP/IP and gone on to new
horizons. Same thing goes for ISO (which there is not a whole lot of
'practical experience' in, anyway).

I have a small piece of internet in my dining room. It's not connected
to the rest of the world yet (give me another few months), but soon it
will spread through the rest of the house. And you can buy a toaster
with a microprocessor in it from Sears. No ethernet, yet.

This reminds me of a remark Gurshuran Sidhu made at an Apple networking
conference a couple years ago. He described Ethernet addresses as having
been "designed to be intergalactically unique."

The biggest problem, I think, is that 32 bits (or 48, or whatever) is
certainly big enough to serve as a *physical* addressing scheme, but
we keep chopping up addresses so that we can have a *logical* addressing
scheme. I mean, we have a Class C address, and we've got a whopping
four hosts. That's 1.5% utilization. Of course, it's nice to be able
to add hosts as we get them, and subnetting makes contiguous blocks A
Good Thing, but it still means that the address space is sparsely
populated if you think of it as a physical address space.

One advantage that I see IP having over OSI (from what I understand
about OSI addressing, anyway), is that the encoding scheme is very
simple, thus giving some of the advantages of both physical and
logical addressing.

I remember the NCP/TCP switchover. It will be a lot harder the next time...
