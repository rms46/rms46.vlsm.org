IETF interim members of PSO Protocol Council 


Dear colleagues,

As requested by Fred Baker on July 26, the IAB has now appointed 
the IETF's two interim members of the ICANN PSO Protocol Council,
following an open call for nominations. These members, who will 
serve at least until a definitive selection mechanism is put in 
place, are

   Steve Bellovin 
   Leslie Daigle

and I thank them and the various other nominees for their
willingness to serve.
 
Regards

   Brian E Carpenter (IAB Chair)
