IAB -- 22 December 1998 -- IETF-Announce
----------------------------------------

IANA Designation 

The IAB notes that constructive discussions concerning
ICANN and its relationships with various parts of the
community are continuing.  In order to avoid either
preempting those discussions or leaving a gap in coverage 
of the IANA function, the IAB has decided to renew the 
current designation of ISI to execute the IANA function 
for a further three months, until the end of March 1999.
