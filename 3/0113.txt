POISED Chair -- 9 January 1993 -- IETF

Re: Volunteers sought for IAB and IESG Nominating Committee



As Vint said, volunteers are now sought to recruit and nominate people
for half of the IESG and half of the IAB positions.

The goal is to have the selection complete by the end of February,
preferably, and in any case by early March.  This will give the ISOC
and IAB time to approve the selections, and it will provide a few days
for the selected people to prepare.  The terms for these offices begin
with the end of the next IETF meeting at the *end* of March.  (I think
Vint misstated the date in his message.)

As chair of the POISED effort, I will be happy to assist in whatever
way I can.  (My job as Area Director for Security is *not* one of the
jobs up for selection this year.)

The committee will have its work cut out for it.  Roughly a dozen
positions need to be filled.  Of course, many have incumbents who wish
to serve again, but the committee must still consider all the options.
Representatives from the various official bodies will participate on a
non-voting basis, and the committee can consult with whomever it
wishes.

To make this work, we need volunteers who are knowledgeable and
committed to seeing the IAB and IESG continue their fine service to
the community.  There will be a frenetic month to six weeks of
activity, and then the committee gets to disband.  Give it some
thought and volunteer if you think you can do the job.
