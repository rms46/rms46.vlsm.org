ISOC Trustees -- 27 March 1993 -- IETF
--------------------------------------

Status of IAB nominations


The nominating committee has provided to the Internet Society
Trustees its results for the IAB positions and the Trustees have
requested additional background information prior to completing
their evaluation.

The Trustees will work diligently to complete their part, but
the procedures for meetings other than face to face typically
allow two weeks at least and possibly more, if needed, to complete
this work. It is hoped it will take less time than that.

Under the procedures adopted for this first implementation of
the POISED recommendations, the entire process is considered
private, given that it pertains to personal information and
evaluation (for the same reason, the work of the nominating
committee is also considered private).

As soon as the new IAB can be seated, the nominating committee
is expected to present to it recommendations for IESG positions.
