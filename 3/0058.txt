William Allen Simpson -- 1 May 1999 -- IAB
------------------------------------------

This is a formal appeal of the IESG decision of 01 Mar 1999.

 1) The decision was not timely.  The documents had already been published.
    The RFC Editor had promised not to publish the documents until the
    issues had been resolved.

 2) The answers by the IESG are non-responsive; particularly to points
    #9, #14, #15, #17, #18.  The appeal explicitly listed "other
    documents" in its subject, and explicitly addressed issues of cross
    reference.

 3) The answers contain numerous false statements, unsupported by the
    WG record.

 4) The answer concludes with an ad hominem attack on appellant.

 5) Specific responses are indicated in the body of the included message.

 6) Appellant desires the opportunity to argue each point in detail
    before the IAB, and answer any questions the IAB might have,
    presumably in conference call.

I can find no evidence to support the IESG position that the WG decided
at any time to support key lengths of 40 bits.  Indeed, there are a
preponderance of messages opposing the 40-bit recommendation.

The discussion of entropy has already been addressed in earlier RFCs.

It has long been the formal position of the IETF that the minimum number
of unknown bits for IP Security keys was at least 56 bits.  This was the
subject of an open plenary that specifically discussed an IBM hashing
proposal for 40 bits.  It is not in the purview of a WG (nor the IESG)
to override the express decision of the IETF as a whole without
substational justifcation, and open discussion.  This was raised in the
Last Call.

This IESG answer is technically incompetent, and just plain silly.
Differential cryptanalysis has been a known attack for many years.

The designers of DES (early 1970s) admit having designed it to be
resistant against this attack.  The designers of every other algorithm
listed in this document have designed their algorithms to be resistant
to this attack.  Indeed, most claim that the attack is _impossible_
against their algorithms.

As stated, such an attack is "impractical".  While this is a term of
art, its implications should be discernable to the IESG.  For a more
complete discussion, see the references in RFC-1829 and RFC-1851.

I remind the IAB that "Deep Crack" was successful using brute force,
rather than differential cryptanalysis.

While I agree that a proposed standard may be immature, I do not believe
that publishing a document with _known_ technical errors is appropriate.

And as it is admitted by the IESG that the document does not conform to
the adopted and approved "roadmap", that alone would qualify it for
return to the WG.

This document was a late addition, not included in the original last
call.  I had submitted appropriate edits to the last call documents that
would eliminate references to this document, so that it would not need
to be published until it was fixed.

The IESG chose to ignore the edits, which is inappropriate process.

But the document does not.  That's the point.

This illustrates the failure of the IESG to understand the purpose of
the roadmap.

RFC-1829 and RFC-1851 (and RFC-2405) are examples of "cipher" documents.
They do not define ciphers, they define how ciphers are to be used in
the IP Security environment.

This is either a "cipher" document, subject to roadmap requirements, or
it is not a "cipher" document.  If it is not a cipher document, then it
must be informational, rather than a proposed standard.

Again, this illustrates the failure of the IESG to understand the purpose
of the roadmap.

Again, this illustrates the failure of the IESG to understand the purpose

This is an appealable judgement call.  Unlike RFC-1829 and 1851, the
security considerations do not discuss known analysis of the algorithms,
and fails in many other respects to the requirements of the roadmap.

I am still unaware of any substantive and credible response, and the
answer does not reference any particular response.

Moreover, if the CBC document does not meet the roadmap cipher
requirements, but there exist substantive documents that do, why have
the substantive documents _not_ been published?

It is never-the-less a process issue, as the long-standing IETF practice
is not followed, and this was taken without considerable rationale.

This answer is non-responsive.  3DES and DESX are both "optional", and
were refused Proposed Standard status.  If it is no longer an issue,
then 3DES and DESX are overdue.

Explicitly included in this appeal were the failure to publish 3DES and
DESX as Proposed Standards.  See the first paragraph (of the original
appeal language).

I interject that the "words" are the issue.

Why is it that so many folks like my writing so much, that they take my
words in their entirety, but my work isn't good enough to be published
with my own name on it?

I interject that there has always been an important difference.  I have
always included an extensive list of contributors, cited specific
contributions, and where the contributions were substantial, invited the
writers as co-authors.  That is, followed academic practice.  Contrast
what has happened with this and the other appealed documents.

This answer is manifestly and egregiously false and misleading.  In an
earlier message, during last call, I submitted detailed language to the
IESG.  And see #17 below.

I disagree that the acknowledgements are sufficient.  Moreover, I am
unaware of the "significant portion" that was written by the editors.

This is a serious process violation.  The documents must either be last
called, or rejected.  Neither has happened.  And that is a subject of
this appeal that is not addressed.

I interject that this is a malicious and egregiously false statement,

There was clear technical evidence of error submitted during last call

I was one of the 4 founders of the IP Security WG.  The first drafts of
the packet design that are now ESP were written in my hotel room -- that
I shared with Fred Baker -- in 1992.  I was present at the early
luncheon meetings, the BOFs, and most WG meetings.  I wrote most of the
early text, including contributions to other authors' works.

I object to the unsubstantiated ad hominem attack, and false history.

I object to the removal of references to my (and others) work, and
deprecation of my contributions.
