Confirmation of the New IESG Slate

The IAB/IESG Nominating Committee is pleased to announce that its slate
of new members for the IESG has recently been formally confirmed by the
IAB.

Although there will be a formal announcement at this Thursday's
Plenary, we would like IETF members to be aware that the newly
appointed IESG members are:

Chair: Fred Baker
Applications AD: Keith Moore
Internet AD: Jeffrey Burgan
Operational Requirements AD: Mike O'Dell
Routing AD: Joel Halpern
Security AD: Jeff Schiller
User Services AD: Joyce Reynolds

These seven join the five whose terms are *not* expiring this year:

Applications AD: Harald Alvestrand
Internet AD: Frank Kastenholz
Network Management: Deirdre Kostick
Operational Requirements AD: Scott Bradner
Transport AD: Allison Mankin

Each of us should also extend our thanks to the outgoing IESG members,
John Klensin, Paul Mockapetris, and Susan Thomson, for their
contributions while serving on the current IESG.

Regards,
-- Guy
