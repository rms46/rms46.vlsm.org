NomCom Chair -- 11 January 1996 -- IETF-Announce
------------------------------------------------

IESG/IAB Nominations Committee Web Page

As chair of the IAB/IESG NomCom, I'd like to invite and encourage the
broadest participation by the entire IETF community in the nominations
process.

For details, please review the web page at

http://www.advanced.org/Almes/nomcom-top.htm

which includes:
<> status of the nominations process for the IAB
<> status of the nominations process for the IESG
<> information on how to contact the NomCom itself.

The NomCom reviews all open positions. It may re-nominate the current
occupant of a position or may nominate a replacement, based on comments
and suggestions from the community. The members of the NomCom strongly
request the participation of the entire IETF community in the
nominating process. Each member of the IETF should feel free to
nominate individuals for any of the open IAB or IESG positions. Each
member of the IETF should also feel free to make suggestions to the
NomCom, including comments about possible nominees.
