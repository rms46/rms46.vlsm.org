IESG Chair -- 6 February 1997 -- IETF
-------------------------------------

Re: IETF Nominations Committee Report

I want to thank Geoff Huston for the work of the Nominating Committee in
selecting new Area Directors. I would like also to thank our three outgoing
Area Directors for their efforts over the past several years. These Area
Directors are:

        Frank Kastenholz        Internet
        Deirdre Kostick         Network Management
        Allison Mankin          Transport & IPNG

The new IESG, effective the evening of 4/10/96, will therefore be:

Fred Baker          IETF Chair               <fred@cisco.com>
Harald Alvestrand   Applications             <Harald.T.Alvestrand@uninett.no>
Keith Moore         Applications             <moore+iesg@cs.utk.edu>
Scott Bradner       Transport Services       <sob@harvard.edu>
Allyn Romanow       Transport Services       <allyn@eng.sun.com>
Jeffrey Burgan      Internet                 <jburgan@baynetworks.com>
Thomas Narten       Internet                 <narten@raleigh.ibm.com>
Mike O'Dell         Operations & Management  <mo@uunet.uu.net>
John Curran         Operations & Management  <jcurran@bbnplanet.com>
Joyce K. Reynolds   User Services            <jkrey@isi.edu>
Jeff Schiller       Security                 <jis-iesg@big-screw.mit.edu>
Joel Halpern        Routing                  <jhalpern@newbridge.com>
Steve Coya          IETF Executive Director  <scoya@ietf.org>

The new IAB chair and an IAB liaison will also be members of the IESG.

The IESG is acting to effect a smooth switchover, by adding Tom Narten and
John Curran to its mailing list and by inviting them to join the IESG in
its activities at the Memphis IETF prior to their installation. We expect
that they and Scott Bradner will join the sitting Area Directors in their
duties during that meeting. However, as the installation of new Area
Directors occurs during the Thursday evening plenary meeting, they will not
actually have that authority until Thursday, and the sitting Area Directors
will be authoritative until Thursday evening.

The merger of the Operations and Network Management areas will be effective
as of the beginning of that meeting.  For the duration of the meeting there
will be three Area Directors: Mike O'Dell, Scott Bradner, and Deirdre
Kostick.  After the meeting ADs for the O&M area will be Mike O'Dell and
John Curran.
