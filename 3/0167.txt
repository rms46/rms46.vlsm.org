                World-Wide Web BOF (www)
                Chairperson: Tim Berners-Lee/CERN
                Timeslot: Tuesday, March 30th - 4-6pm

The World-Wide Web (WWW) is a distributed information access system
providing facilities from simple campus-wide systems to multimedia
hypertext information delivery and search.  WWW has an established
user base, many compatible implementations, and many new ideas.  This
BOF will discuss how the current WWW standards should be put into the
RFC process, and discuss future directions for the Web.
