                            domain name resolvers

Two different domain name resolvers were developed and experimented with
for Berkeley Unix. The DRUID system was developed by Peter Karp at
Stanford University. The BIND system was developed by Doug Terry at
Berkeley. The Unix support group at Berkeley is preparing a major revision
of the BIND system for inclusion in the next release of Berkeley Unix.
These systems (both DRUID and BIND) are not just the resolver, but include
servers as well.
