IAB -- 30 March 1999 -- IETF-Announce
-------------------------------------

IANA Designation 

The IAB notes that constructive discussions concerning
the relationship between ICANN and the IETF are continuing.
In order to avoid either preempting those discussions or 
leaving a gap in coverage of the IANA function, the IAB has 
decided to renew the designation of the current IANA team
in Marina del Rey, California to execute the IANA function 
for a further three months, until the end of June 1999.
