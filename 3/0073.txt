IESG Chair -- 7 November 1994 -- IETF-Announce
----------------------------------------------

Announcing the Chair's contest for the IETF Logo

As part of the IETF's efforts to improve its image, the IETF logo
contest opens today. Anyone, with the exception of the judges, may
enter a design. Entries will be accepted until midnight December 2.

Entries will be judged by the panel of Stev Knowles and Michael O'Dell,
with ties being broken by the IETF chair. Entries become the property
of the IETF. The winner will be announced at the Thursday plenary in
San Jose.

Entries must be suitable for use on the IETF home page and documents.
Entries must be submitted to logo@cnri.reston.va.us. Entries may be
PS or GIF, with other formats by prior agreement. Alternatively, you
may send a location and file name for the judges to get via ftp.

The prize will include a six pack of Jolt cola and T-shirts donated to
the contest by an appreciative Internet community. We expect the
T-shirts to be plentiful.
