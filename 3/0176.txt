                On-Line Directories: IETF and Internet-Drafts

Several months ago the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
announced the availability of two newly revised directories
installed at NIC.DDN.MIL: "IETF:" and "Internet-Drafts:". This
message repeats the brief description of those directories and
provides a NEW list of the most recently installed Internet-Drafts.

The IETF directory has been established as an aid to both veteran IETF
members and newcomers. It comprises files containing: a general
description of the IETF (history, organization, goals); a description
of the Internet Activities Board; a summary of active Working Groups
within the IETF; IETF meeting dates/locations; upcoming meeting
information and an associated RSVP form; the upcoming meeting
agenda; and a README file with an overview of directory contents. In
addition, individual files have been dedicated to each Working Group
and their particular activities. These files contain respective Charters,
Status Updates and Current Meeting Reports. The WG files are named in
the following fashion:

                <WG NAME>.charter
                <WG NAME>.status
                <WG NAME>.report

The Internet-Drafts directory presents drafts for review and comment.
It contains documents that will be submitted to the RFC Editor for
consideration, or will be simply discarded when their purpose has been
served. Comments are welcomed and should be addressed to the responsible
persons whose names and email addresses are listed on the first page of
each draft. Each Internet-Draft is placed in a separate file; the following
standard naming scheme is used:

File Format Naming Scheme

ascii text DRAFT-<TFNAME>-<WGNAME>-<ABBREVTITLE>-<REVNO>.TXT
Postscript DRAFT-<TFNAME>-<WGNAME>-<ABBREVTITLE>-<REVNO>.PS
unix compressed ascii DRAFT-<TFNAME>-<WGNAME>-<ABBREVTITLE>-<REVNO>.TXTZ
unix compressed DRAFT-<TFNAME>-<WGNAME>-<ABBREVTITLE>-<REVNO>.PSZ
  Postscript

If the document is not being authored in a Task Force, then the author's
name
will be substituted for the Working Group name (WGNAME) and an
organizational
affiliation will be submitted for the Task Force name (TFNAME). Example:

         DRAFT-<ORG>-<AUTHORNAME>-<ABBREVTITLE>-<REVNO>.TXT

                                        RFC822

The Internet-Draft directory also contains a README file and an
Index-Abstract file to aid the reader in locating drafts of interest.

As stated earlier, both the IETF and Internet-Drafts directories are
available on-line at NIC.DDN.MIL (west coast). The directory names
are: "IETF:" and "Internet-Drafts:". By the end of September shadow
directories will be installed at NNSC.NSF.NET for the convenience
of the east coast Internet community. (The directory names will not be
quite the same: "IETF" and "Internet-Drafts". The colon is placed in the
NIC.DDN.MIL-installed directories' names to accommodate the TOPS 20
system employed.)

The current directories can be accessed by anonymous ftp. The "ls" or
"dir" command will permit a review of what files are available and the
specific naming scheme to use for a successful anonymous ftp action.
