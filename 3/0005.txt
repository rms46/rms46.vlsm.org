IESG Handling of IPng documents


The IESG has determined how documents from the IPng candidates will be
treated when they are submitted to the IESG for publication as RFCs.

 1. All IPng-related documents will be submitted for publication as
    RFCs in normal fashion; that is, as soon as the working group and
    the area directorate recommends that the IESG review them for
    publication. All IPng-related RFCs will be published with
    Experimental status. All IPng-related RFCs will remain in
    Experimental status until a single IPng is selected.

2. At some point, one IPng shall be selected, and it will be moved onto
   the standards track as defined in RFC1310 (or its successor). An
   Applicability Statement will be prepared to assign a status of
   "Recommended" as the Common IPng for Internet interoperability.

3. Once a "Common IPng" protocol has been selected, the other (former)
   IPng candidates will be treated in normal fashion.  That is, they
   may eventually be moved to Historic status, or, if recommended by
   the working group and area directorate, they may be moved onto the
   standards track. However, because there can be only one level three
   protocol with a status of "Recommended as the Common IPng for
   Internet interoperability", an Applicability Statement must be
   prepared that clearly distinguishes between the subject protocol and
   the "Recommended Common IPng".
