NomCom -- 24 March 1993 -- IETF

IAB/IETF Nominations Committee


the purpose of this note is to provide a brief status report

we're still working
we're not done yet
we hoped to have been done by last friday but that wasn't possible

the pressure to finish is high
the pressure to produce quality candidates is high
we are dealing with these competing pressures

we met by teleconference yesterday and plans to meet again later today

we hope to finish the IAB nominations today and the IESG nominations shortly
thereafter (barring a miracle, it is almost certainly too much to hope that
we can finish everything today)

regards,
jdc
