IAB and IESG Nominations Chair - John Curran/BBN


I am pleased to report that John Curran at BBN's Internet Services
Company has agreed to serve as the 1995 IAB/IESG nominations
chairperson.

This is, as always, an ambitious undertaking and now it is your
professional responsibility to assist in any way you can.

Persons who have attended at least 2 IETF meetings are eligible to
volunteer to serve on the nominations committee. Volunteers should send
email to:

nomcom@bbn.com

with appropriate contact information (email address, work telephone,
work fax, home telephone, home fax, postal address for any
correspondence). The list of volunteers will be verified as to
qualification using the IETF secretariat attendance records at CNRI. A
nominations committee will be formed from a randomly selected subset of
the qualified volunteers.

A list of IESG positions to be filled and IAB positions to be
reconsidered will be published shortly. Please give serious
consideration to possible candidates to fill these posts and make these
suggestions known to John, who will share them with the committee.
