IESG review of draft-hubbard-registry-guidelines-03.txt

The Internet-Draft draft-hubbard-registry-guidelines-03.txt was forwarded
to the IESG for consideration as a BCP after working group last-call within
the cidrd working group and IETF Last-Call.  The IESG had a spirited
discussion about this document.  What follows are comments by three IESG
members which detail their specific thoughts on the document.  As you can
see by these examples, a number of IESG members put significant effort into
their reviews (this includes a number of IESG members who support the
document as-is)

As the sponsoring AD for this document I favor its acceptance but I do
agree with a number of the comments made here and feel that a stronger
document would result from the consideration of some of the points.  (it
should be noted that I do not agree with all of the comments though)

At this point I think there are 4 options:

1/ The authors of the document create a revised version taking some or all
of the following comments into account.

2/ The working group &/or the authors withdraws the request for the
document to be published as a BCP and requests publication as an
Informational RFC (with or without changes).

3/ The document is withdrawn and published outside of the IETF. 

4/ The document is withdrawn and not published.

I think the working group should review and discuss the IESG comments then
decide on a course of action.

My own feelings:

As I said above, I think that revisions based on some of the comments would
make a better document whatever the publication decision.

Some of the issues raised in the IESG and during the IETF Last-Call about
this draft are made more confusing by a vague (or explicit) feeling on the
part of some IESG members, and some others in the community, that the IETF
should not be trying to play a role in reviewing or helping formulate
operational-type documents like this draft.  

I feel that if the IETF were to forgo the opportunity to be involved in
this sort of thing it would not (nor should not) stop the development of
such documents but that the resulting documents would not get as wide a
community review and would tend to be more directly reflective of the
specific concerns of those who develop the documents and less likely to
take into account wider issues.  I also feel that the interplay between the
type of people involved in Internet operations and those in the IETF that
attempt to deal with developing protocols is very important.  If the IETF
were to abdicate its role in discussing operational issues there might be
less reason for some of the operations specific people to involve
themselves in the IETF and the IETF would be much the poorer for that.

So I guess what I'm arguing for is that the working group & authors review
& discuss these comments (rather than saying 'the hell with them') and
produce a revised document.  At that point, while I'd rather the document
be resubmitted as a BCP I could understand and support a move to just
publish an Informational RFC and get the process over with.

From: "Jeffrey I. Schiller" <jis@mit.edu>

Looks like I am going to be voting "discuss" on
draft-hubbard-registry-guidelines-03.txt. Let me explain why.

                                General

The document is written from a very one-sided point of view, namely that
of "those in charge" dictating policy to "those who must do what we
say." The fact that the registry system is an effective monopoly doesn't
help.

One key missing component is accountability of the registry system to
the community. There are a lot of words in the document about the
registry's right to audit and verify the correct use of address space on
the part of end-user organizations and ISPs.  However there are no words
subjecting the registries to any audit to demonstrate that they are in
fact allocating address space according to this document (or any other)
or that the registries are being fair in any way.

I know that in the arena of domain name allocations, requests for
information regarding statistics on the number of names being revoked
are answered with "none of your business" or "we must protect the
privacy of the community" or something similar.

The problem of IP address space allocation is real and we should not
ignore it. However mechanisms and methods of controlling the allocation
should be fair and take into account the requirements of ISP's and end
user organizations.  This one doesn't (I'll point out some examples
below):

                             Some Specifics

[This list of problems isn't complete, but should give you the feel
of where I am at...]

Why multiple locations? A large regional ISP might still be default-free
and exchange routing at one major NAP in their area. Why should they be
disqualified?

This isn't good, it can lead to a run around as one regional registry
refers the ISP to another and another... A clearer procedure (which will
converge) is really needed.

"at any time"? How about "given reasonable notice." Most sane
organizations do not agree to contracts with clauses like this. There
needs to be a statement of reasonableness and a limit on how often such
intrusions may be made.

>        In extreme cases, existing loans may be impacted.

This might effect uninvolved third parties (like the ISP's customers,
who are blameless). THIS LANGUAGE IMPLIES THAT THE REGISTRIES *OWN* THE
IP ADDRESS SPACE AND MAY REVOKE ALLOCATIONS BASED ON SUBJECTIVE
JUDGMENTS.  THIS SHOULD SIMPLY NOT BE!!!

The Registries should also be prepared to sign a Non-disclosure
agreement with any party that they demand information (of any kind)
from. Perhaps the prototype agreement should be part of this document. I
know that later in the document it states that Registries should keep
customer (ISP or end-user) information confidential.

Why? Where is the line drawn? Can an end-user organization provide IP
addresses to unaffiliated parties who might use its PPP dialup service?
Who decides what is reasonable here?

I can go on, but I think you get the idea...

>From mankin@ISI.EDU Wed Jul 31 08:04:10 1996

I want to add to Jeff's
concerns (these are just the comments that I think should be
sent back with the document.  I too think the restrictions in here
could drive most organizations and ISPs to never try to get IPv4 addresses
again, whatever that means they have to do...).

Grandfathering needed:

There's no clear presentation of the status of
reassignments and registration for addresses that were
obtained from the IANA and for addresses that were
obtained from registries before this document.  

Legal responsibility and entities:

Do I recall correctly that this document had a legal review
by our counsel?  I think they slipped.  Please redouble Jeff's
point that the comments about organizations not-redelegating
are bizarre, because this means that the registries are in
control of both who can be a sub-registry and who can be an ISP.

Legal responsibility seems to be punted in an ingenuous way.
If this document passes IESG review, I will insist on an IESG
hold-harmless message.  Example of the ingenuous:  the registry
makes the determination that the address isn't required, but
IANA does the invalidation.  Who's responsible?

> Invalidation:

> IANA reserves the right to invalidate any IP assignments once it is
> determined the the requirement for the address space no longer exists.

Appeal:

The IANA is an author of these guidelines, therefore, there isn't
a neutral appeal path available.  Since IANA reports to IAB, the IAB
should be the appellate of last resort.

General comments on the document:

I corresponded with lots of people in trying to review this document.
I made a special attempt to talk with people who run small ISPs, since
it seemed that they were the most likely to be unfairly injured by the
policies proposed here.  

*Everyone* that I talked to agreed on the need to conserve address
space and to assign address blocks so as to minimize the number of
routing table entries and the number of routing updates.  However,
there was also considerable feeling that the particular policy 
recommended here was designed to favor large ISPs even more than 
necessary to meet its stated goals.

I asked these people for concrete, technical suggestions to make the
proposal less discriminatory.  I got the following suggestions:

a. make it easier for startup ISPs to get initial chunks of address
   space while building a customer base.  one suggestion was to give 
   them their own address space which would be taken away if they did 
   not meet the minimum requirements within six months or a year.

b. force RRs to be less capricious in address assignment.  One ISP
   complained to me that he had difficulty getting address blocks
   from the Internic even though he was multi-homed, did not do
   default routing, and did connect to multiple exchange points --
   even though he was paying the price for portable addresses,
   he was still told to go to his "upstream" ISP.

My own feeling is that any policy that favors some ISPs over others
must have strong technical justification.  I recognize that natural
economic laws (e.g. economies of scale) may favor large ISPs over
small ones, but we must be careful that we do not further tip the
scales without a good reason.  Fixing this may require only
clarification or slight changes to the policies described in the
draft, but I believe it's worth considering more radical changes
(if the ideas haven't already been considered by the WG).

In addition to these concerns, I have concerns about the wording of
the document.  The policies described here may well determine whether
particular businesses will succeed or fail, whether people keep or
lose their jobs, and perhaps even whether fortunes are won or lost.
In other words, this document seems particularly likely to be
scrutinized by judges and lawyers.  

We thus have a strong interest in:

+ stating the policy in the clearest way possible (to avoid varying
  interpretations that must be settled in court), 
  
   (for instance, the distinction between "allocation" and
   "assignment", the definition of an ISP, whether an ISP
   can also be an "end enterprise", the requirements for 
   justification of space requirements and for appeals,
   all need to be made very clear and explicit)

+ making sure that there's strong and explicit technical
  justification for the decisions made (to minimize the possibility of
  having the decisions overturned by an uninformed court),  and

+ explicitly stating the assumptions that led to the policy (to better
  inform any court which considers whether to second-guess the
  judgement of the IETF).

  (for instance, it could explicitly state that we don't have the
  authority to force the ISPs to spend money on bigger routers, thus the 
  need to choose a policy that was technically sound given that IETF
  could not require such expenditures )

What follows is a markup of the document with my comments interspersed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>  Status of this Memo
>  
>     "This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This

If this memo is going to be a BCP, it needs a different paragraph
here.  

Another point re Status of this memo: BCPs are new, and we're still
figuring out how to handle them.  One feature of the Internet
Standards track is that a Proposed Standard document is subject to
additional review as it progresses.  There is no such provision for
BCPs, even though they are considered "current".  A "current practice"
is presumably not "best" forever, yet we have not defined any
mechanism by which BCPs are abandoned, or superceded.

While many feel that the guidelines defined in this document are
necessary, the eventual effect of these guidelines cannot be reliably
predicted.  These guidelines are at least as "experimental" as any new
protocol (whether on the standards track or not), and they will almost
certainly need to be modified based on experience.

I therefore believe that every BCP (including this document) should be
automatically re-evaluated by IESG at some pre-determined time from
the time of adoption, and that it be deemed to have expired if IESG
has not re-confirmed or replaced it within six months of its
re-evaluation date.  For this document, I'd suggest a re-evaluation
date of six months.  This is not a long time, but at current Internet
growth rates, the number of addresses assigned during that time should
a signifcant portion of the total number of addresses then in use.

"Internet" should be "Internet Protocol version 4" for clarity.  IPv6
should afford more flexibility in address assignment, even if it
doesn't alleviate the routing problems.  These assignment policies
should certainly be reconsidered for IPv6.

I disagree with this statement.

The policy described here is not inherently forced by limitations of
existing technology.  It is an engineering, economic, and perhaps
even political, compromise.

We could recommend a policy that expects everyone to install more
expensive routers with more memory and faster cpus.  This would cost a
certain amount of money per router, and might also force
earlier-than-expected replacement of a lot of deployed hardware.

We could recommend a policy that anticipates the building of regional
interconnection points, with blocks of addresses delegated to those
connection points rather than to ISPs.  Such addresses would then be
portable to any ISP that connected at that connection point.  This
would provide additional flexibility for customers but would cost
money for ISPs (and thus increase service cost).  It would also have
some impact on the reliability of the net.

The policy recommended here forces small ISPs to either pony up for
larger routers and more connections, or be vulnerable to rate changes
and variations in the service quality from their upstream provider,
which in turn penalizes the customers of those small ISPs.

I've haven't seen any cost analysis to justify these design choices.  I
can well believe that some of them are inherently cheaper -- for
everyone -- than others.  But it appears that the choice here
is based not only on how much it costs to keep the network running,
but (at least partially) on who bears that cost.

Of course, a large part of the policy choice is based on the
assumption of what can be controlled.  If we dictated that large ISPs
had to install new links or routers, there's a good chance that they
would balk.  We can at least hope to exercise some control over
address assignment.  It probably wouldn't hurt to make such
assumptions explicit in the document.

The goal of this policy should be to try to make a reasonable balance
between the needs of customers, small ISPs, and large ISPs, given the
technology available today and the relative costs of different
solutions.  This document should explain how it attempts to acheive
these goals.

It is very difficult to justify use of the term "fair" to describe a
policy that inherently favors some competitors over others, unless
there is strong technical justification for the policy.  Such
justification is not present in this document.

There seems to be an implicit decision to build the "hierarchy" with
big ISPs at the top, little ones in the middle, and customers at the
bottom, rather than using geographic divisions even at the topmost
levels.  This decision, and the reasons for it, should be made
explicit.

The policy described here pursues these goals for the short- or
medium- term only.  The topology of the net can be expected to change
considerably in a few years' time, especially as competition
between ISPs forces them to optimize routes to minimize costs, or (for
instance) as user populations shift from traditional urban areas to
"edge cities".  For routing to remain efficient over such a period,
changes in address assignment should follow changes in topology.  But
the policy as written encourages well-connected ISPs (and presumably,
their customers) to keep their address assignments even though
less-well-connected ISPs are forced to change theirs.  

The policy described here assumes aggregation of routes based on
provider, rather than aggregation of routes based on network topology.
It thus encourages a "route to recipient's provider" strategy rather
than a "route to recipient's neighborhood" strategy.  While this might
make sense in today's world (particularly in the absence of any
inter-provider settlement mechanisms), it doesn't necessarily make
sense in the long term, especially from a customer's point-of-view.

Perhaps a short-term or medium-term policy is appropriate if one
assumes that IPv4 is dying anyway, and that we will all be running
IPv6 in a few years.  But a more reasonable policy might be one that
loaned *all* addresses on a fixed-term, temporary basis.  This would
require everyone (not just small ISPs and their customers) to change
addresses periodically (presumably every few years), or when they
change providers.  This would appear to:

- encourage the development of renumbering tools (and, perhaps 
  unfortunately, also increase the demand for address translation devices).
  Either way, the tools will make it easier for customers to renumber,
  and thus easier to switch providers as they deem necessary.

- allow changes in address assignment to reflect then-current topology

- allow coalescing of initial fragmentary allocations 

- allow more robust routing strategies if settlements are ever worked out

- be "fair" in that it doesn't force some people to renumber and not
  others

- allow address allocations to adapt to actual usage rather than to reflect
  anticipated usage.

- extend the life potential of IPv4 (by allowing more efficient assignment), 
  but also make it easier to transition to IPv6 (since people would have 
  to renumber anyway).

- extend the life potential of currently deployed routing equipment

Perhaps there are drawbacks to this that I'm not aware of, but I have
a difficult time understanding the justification for a policy that
says "it's okay to force small ISPs and their customers to renumber,
but not to to the same to large ISPs and their customers"
... particularly when the renumbering technology has to be developed
anyway, when such a policy *does* appear to be within the bounds of
what we can dictate (as opposed to, say, capital expenditures of
ISPs), and when there appear to be significant technical benefits to
forcing everyone to renumber occasionally.

The document really needs some up-front definitions for key terms such as:

+ ISP (i.e. does anybody who resells IP service qualify as an ISP?),
+ customer,
+ end enterprise,
+ upstream provider (what if there is more than one?)
+ assignment
+ allocation
+ delegation

There is a slight conflict between the language here and the language above
At first, the requirements for an ISP to get its own allocation appear to be:

a1. exchange routing information with other ISPs at multiple locations, and
b1. operate without default routing

then they are stated to be

a2. be directly connected to a "major" routing exchange
b2. be multi-homed

Although these are very similar, they are not equivalent.  An ISP
could connect to 'other' ISPs (does 'other ISPs' imply 'multiple
ISPs') at multiple locations, without being connected to a major
routing exchange.  An ISP could also be multi-homed and still do
default routing (though one wonders why they would bother).

My point is that this is going to be a very important criterion;
it needs to be absolutely clear whether an ISP qualifies or not.
Having two sets of slightly different criteria makes this muddy,
and invites capricious decision-making on the part of the IRs.

Also, there's a bit of a bias here toward assignment of addresses to
"ISPs", that I have a hard time finding a technical basis for.  For
example, why couldn't two or more ISPs in an area set up a common
exchange point and ask for an allocation on behalf of that exchange
point and the aggregated needs of their customers?  That would allow
routing to that exchange point for any of the member ISPs; it could
also allow customers of those ISPs to switch to any of the other
member providers without changing addresses.  

>     Note that addresses issued directly from the IRs, (non-provider
>  based), are the least likely to be routable across the Internet.

This glosses over an important point which should be made explicit.
I'd say it much more like so:

While ISPs are presumably willing to route traffic for addresses that
they assign, this does not necessarily mean that they will be willing
to route traffic for addresses not obtained from the ISP.  Routing
table entries, and especially the memory and bandwidth required to
process routing table updates, are scarce and valuable resources.  In
other words, it costs money for an ISP to route a block of addresses,
and ISP A might well choose to recover that cost by billing other ISPs
for the service of routing addresses not assigned to ISP A.

In any event, assignment of a block of addresses by an IR does not
imply that the addresses will be routed by other ISPs.  The assignee
of a block of addresses must separate arrangements with other ISPs if
it wishes them to route that block of addresses.

>  The following are the IP allocation guidelines for ISPs:

This heading needs to be clearer.  

There are at least three cases which should be considered in detail:

+ "assignment" of IP addresses by RRs (or IRs!) to ISPs,
+ "allocation" from "upstream" ISPs to ("downstream"?) ISPs, and
+ "allocation" from an ISP to its non-ISP customers

The document needs to be very clear which recommendations and/or rules
address which cases; the rules for each case should be listed
separately.  The difference between the words "allocation" and
"assignment" isn't sufficient to cover the cases, and the meanings of
the words are so similar that the two are very easily confused.
Neither is it clear whether "customers" which are also ISPs are to be
treated the same as "customers" which are not ISPs.

As others have pointed out, these requirements are too vague.  There
should at least be: an amount of time which the ISP has to respond; a
list of information the ISP has to provide (i.e. how must it justify
giving a /18 to Podunk Auto Supply?); and a requirement that the RR
not use this information for its own commercial gain, or disclose the
information to third parties.

Perhaps the ISP should be allowed to present this information in
summary form; the details to be verified by a third-party auditor of
the ISP's choosing.  Also, there's probably some need for public
review of this data to make sure ISPs aren't cheating, but how much of
the ISP's customer data should be disclosed to the public?  Should
ISPs be required to reveal the size of their customers (say, in terms
of # of workstations), and doesn't this reveal information that their
customers might consider sensitive?

Obviously this isn't going to be fixed for this version of the
document. It will take many months to work these things out, and we
need this document sooner than that.  But it should definitely be
taken up in the next version, and we probably need some
quick-and-dirty interim policy.

I'm sure that this is here for a good reason, but I find it hard to
believe that if (say) Big Telco Inc. decided to go into the ISP
business, that it would not get a bigger chunk of address space than
Nets 'R Us of East Lower Slobbovia, based on its larger projected
customer base.

This is also very vague. *Whose* "routing restrictions" -- the
internal ones of the ISP requesting the allocation or of his upstream
providers, or both?  What is meant by "current or future routing
restrictions"?  Does this mean that the limitations of the current
IPv4 routing infrastructure don't affect an ISP's initial IP
allocation?  (it could easily be taken to mean that)

Is this provision intended to require ISPs to use classless routing?
If so, we should say so.  If not, what is it here for?

Okay, this is under the heading "allocation framework" but it's
talking about assignment.  (I'm not trying to be difficult; I really
did have a hard time sorting all of this out, and I'm still not sure I
understand what is intended.)

If this is what the last part of #4 is supposed to say, perhaps that

Who issues the second opinion?  This looks like the regional registry

It appears that an "end enterprise" or "organization" can get its own
chunk of IP address space merely by being multi-homed, as long as it
does not delegate that space to others.  Can an ISP get such a chunk
for use by its own machines and dialin customers?  (after all, these
are not really delegated to anyone besides the ISP.)
