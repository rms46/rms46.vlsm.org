               The Extended Internet Protocol (EIP)

   So far, three proposals have been put forward as the long-term
   solutions for Internet adressing and routing: Nimrod, Pip and CLNP.
   All of the them require that the current IP to be replaced
   by a completely new "IP". However, as I have said in a previous
   message that IP really is the cornerstone of the current Internet,
   replacing it with a new "IP" requires fundamental changes to all
   aspects of the Internet (eg. routing, routers, hosts, ARP, RARP,
   ICMP, TCP, UDP, DNS, FTP).  Migrating to a new "IP" in effect creates
   a new "Internet".  The development and deployment of such a new
   "Internet" would take a very large amount of time and effort.  To
   ensure interoperability between old and new systems during the
   transition period, the updated hosts and subnet routers have to run
   two sets of protocols in parallel.  An updated host also has to
   determine whether the destination host has been updated or not at the
   beginning of a connection.

   Here we present a solution called Extended Internet Protocol
   (EIP). EIP does not propose any new addressing schemes but a
   framework in which any addressing schemes, such as those proposed in
   Nimrod, Pip,  NSAP, and CityCodes, can be accommodated.
   The goal of EIP is to maintain maximum backward compatibility with
   current IP. It can substantially reduce the modifications to current
   systems and ease the difficulties in transition.  EIP has a number of
   very desirable features:

   1)   EIP expands the address space, yet maintains maximum backward
        compatibility with current IP.

   2)   EIP can accommodate different addressing and routing architec-
        tures such as fixed or variable length addresses, multi-level
        addressing, hierarchical routing and policy routing. It cane be
        used as a vehicle for any new addressing and routing architec-
        tures.

   3)   EIP requires minor modification to the host IP software (ie. a
        new option), to the DNS (ie. a new resource record type), and to
        FTP (ie. a command).

   4)   EIP requires no changes to all assigned IP addresses and subnet
        structures in local are networks.

   5)   EIP requires no modifications to ARP, RARP, ICMP, TCP/UDP check-
        sum.

   In the note, IP refers to the current Internet Protocol
   and EIP refers to the Extended Internet Protocol (EIP is pronounced
   as "ape" - a step forward in the evolution:-).

   The goal of EIP is to provide maximum flexibility to accommodate
   any new addressing scheme and at the meantime
   maintain maximum backward compatibility with current IP. EIP can be
   viewed as an extended version of IP. Before we describe the EIP
   header format, let us first look at the evolution from IP to EIP.
   EIP is developed from IP by:

   1)   Creating a new IP option to hold the Source and Destination Net-
        work IDs.

   2)   Treating the current IP Source and Destination Addresses as the
        Source and Destination Host IDs.

   3)   Using Host IDs only for communications within the same network.

   An EIP addresses have two parts: the EIP Host ID and the EIP Network
   ID. The Network ID identifies a particular network and the Host ID
   identifies a particular host on the network.

   The current 32-bit IP address space is used for the Host ID only. A
   new IP option called "EIP Option" is created to hold the Network ID.
   Using an option to encode the Network ID is the key idea behind the
   EIP; it provides a flexible way of accommodating arbitrary addressing
   schemes while maintaining maximum backward compatibility. Because EIP
   follows the syntax of IP, the modifications required to current
   Internet systems are greatly reduced.

   The semantics of the Network ID encoded in the EIP Option are deter-
   mined by the addressing scheme used and is not discussed in this
   paper. Since EIP Option has a variable length, the Network ID can
   accommodate any addressing schemes.  It can be a fixed length node ID,
   or a fixed length path ID, or a variable length backbone-oriented
   hierarchical address, or a variable length policy source route, or a
   routing directive.  In fact, it allows multiple addressing schemes
   co-existence, which may be used for experimenting new addressing
   schemes in the future.

   The EIP Option format is illustrated in Figure 1.

   The field "type" specifies the addressing scheme used thus determines
   how the Network IDs should be interpreted.  The fields "Source Net-
   work ID" and "Destination Network ID" hold the Source Network ID and
   the Destination Network ID.

   The EIP packet header consists of the minimal IP header, the EIP
   Option and other Options. The actual format is shown in Figure 2.

                    Figure 2: EIP Header Format

   The EIP header differs from the IP header in only two aspects.
   First, the EIP header has the EIP Option which always follows the
   minimal IP header.  The "Source Network ID" and the "Destination Net-
   work ID" fields in the EIP Option are used to identify the source and
   the destination networks.  Second, the "Source Host ID" and "Destina-
   tion Host ID" fields in the EIP header, which correspond to the
   "Source Address" and "Destination Address" fields in the IP header,
   are only used to identify the the source and the destination hosts on
   the respective networks. Other fields in the EIP headers are identi-
   cal to the corresponding fields in the IP header.

   For communications within the same network, there is no need to
   include the Network IDs in the packet. Therefore, the EIP Option
   which contains the Source Network ID and the Destination Network ID
   is included in the packet only when the packet is destined to a
   remote network. In other words, in EIP, when the Source Network ID
   and the Destination Network ID are omitted in the packet header, it
   is assumed, by default, that they are both equal to the local net-
   work.  This is an important feature of EIP which ensures the compati-
   bility of IP and EIP within one network. When EIP is in place, an IP
   host si able to communicate with any hosts within the same network
   without any changes.  In fact, IP and EIP have a identical header
   when they are used within one network. The IP header can be viewed as
   a special case of the EIP header, ie. when communications take place
   within one network.

   A full EIP address consists of a Network ID and a Host.  However,
   Network IDs and Host IDs are always manipulated in separate forms.
   The clear separation of the Network ID and the Host ID in EIP has its
   advantages:

   1)   It maintains full compatibility between IP hosts and EIP hosts
        for communications within one network. Any IP hosts can communi-
        cate with any EIP hosts in the same network without any modifi-
        cations

   2)   It allows the Network IDs to be manipulated more easily When a
        backbone-based hierarchical addressing scheme is used, a network
        may have to change its Network ID when its higher level backbone
        network has been changed and the hosts have to determine which
        Network ID should be used when their networks have access to
        more than one backbone network.

   Now let us look at the modifications to the IP systems that
   are needed for transition to EIP. Because of the similarity between
   the EIP and IP, the amount of modifications needed to current systems
   are substantially reduced.

1)   Network Numbers: Each network has to be assigned a new EIP Network
     ID based on the addressing scheme used. The mapping between the IP
     network numbers and the EIP Network IDs can be used for translation
     service (see below).

2)   Host Numbers: There is no need for assigning EIP Host IDs.  All
     existing hosts can use their current IP addresses as their EIP Host
     IDs. New machines may be allocated any number from the 32-bit Host
     ID space since the structure posed on IP addressing is no longer
     necessary. However, during the transition, allocation of EIP Host
     IDs should still follow the IP addressing rule, so that the EIP
     Host IDs are still globally unique and can still be interpreted as
     IP addresses.  This will allow a more gradual transition to EIP
     (see below).

3)   Translation Service: During the transition period when the EIP Host
     IDs are still unique, an address translation service can be pro-
     vided to IP hosts that need communicate with hosts in other net-
     works. All IP hosts should use the translation server as their
     default router to outside world. When the translation server
     receives a packet, it obtains the Destination Network ID by looking
     up in the mapping table between IP network numbers and EIP Network
     IDs. The translation server then adds the EIP option with Source
     and Destination Network IDs into the packet and forwards to the
     border router. The translation service only applies to out-going
     packets from IP hosts. There is no need for translation for any
     in-coming packets. The border routers may act as the translation
     servers (see below).

4)   Border Routers: The new EIP Option has to be implemented and rout-
     ing has to be done based on the Network ID in the EIP Option. The
     border routers may be used to provide the translation service dur-
     ing the transition period. When a border router receive a packet
     without EIP Option, it looks up the Destination Network ID from the
     mapping table between IP network numbers and EIP Network IDs.  The
     border router then adds the EIP Option and forwards the packet.

5)   Subnet Routers: No modifications are required during the transition
     period when EIP Host IDs (which equals to the IP addresses) are
     still globally unique. A subnet router can still determine, by
     treating the EIP Host ID as the IP addresses, whether a packet is
     destined to remote networks or not and forward correctly. However,
     subnet routers eventually have to implement the EIP Option and
     carry out routing based on Network IDs when EIP Host IDs are no
     longer globally unique.

6)   Hosts: The new EIP Option has to be implemented and routing has to
     be done based on the Network ID in the EIP Option, or based on the
     Host ID and subnet mask if subnetting is used.

7)   DNS: A new resource record (RR) type "N" has to be added for EIP
     Network IDs. The RR type "A", currently used for IP addresses, can
     still be used for EIP Host IDs. RR type "N" entries have to be
     added and RR type "PTR" to be updated.  All other entries remain
     unchanged.

8)   ARP/RARP: No modifications are required. The ARP and RARP are used
     for mapping between EIP Host IDs and physical addresses.

9)   ICMP: No modifications are required.

10)  TCP/UDP Checksum: No modifications are required. The pseudo header
     includes the EIP Source and Destination IDs instead of the source
     and destination IP addresses.

11)  FTP: The "DATA Port (Port)" command has to pass both the EIP Net-
     work and Host IDs. This command, which specifies a data port other
     than the default one, is not needed under normal circumstances thus
     it may be possible to disable this command.
