IESG -- 14 May 1998 -- IETF-Announce
------------------------------------

Last Call: 
Some Thoughts on the Importance of Modesty and Decorum and the Need 
for an IETF Code of Conduct to BCP 

The IESG will consider publication of Some Thoughts on the Importance
of Modesty and Decorum and the Need for an IETF Code of Conduct
<draft-odell-code-of-conduct-02.txt> as a BCP.  This has been reviewed
in the IESG, but is not the product of an IETF Working Group.

The IESG plans to make a decision in the next few weeks, and solicits
final comments on this action.  Please send any comments to the
iesg@ietf.org or ietf@ietf.org mailing lists by June 13, 1998.
