Hi -


As you may or may not know I've been tapped to head this years IAB/IESG 
nominating committee.  This is the second call for volunteers to participate 
as members of that committee.  If you would like to volunteer, please send me 
email (to stjohns@corp.home.net) with the phrase "NOMCOM VOLUNTEER" (yes - all 
caps) in your subject line indicating your desire to participate.  Please 
include your snail mail and phone numbers in the body of the message.  To be 
eligible to serve on the NOMCOM, you must have attended 2 of the last 3 IETFs.

Please make sure you can spend the time required to serve.  Although there 
won't be any face to face meetings except for the December IETF, you will have 
to spend about 2 hours a week on the phone during the 12 active weeks of the 
nominations process (starting around the December IETF) in teleconferences 
with the entire nominations committee.  You'll also be assigned various 
candidates to interview as part of the nominations process.  

Third and last call for volunteers will be next Wednesday, the 27th of August. 
 Cutoff for accepting volunteers will be as of 1600 PDT on the 29th of August 
- specifically, they have to be in my email box at that time. 

Once I've got the complete list of volunteers, I'll post it and also ask that 
the Secretariat verify eligibility.  The 10 members will be selected by lot 
based on the sales volume of 11 stocks as of the NASDAQ market close on 19 
September as reported in the San Jose Mercury News on 20 September 1997.

The procedure is as follows:

1) The Secretariat will provide the final list of eligibles listed in 
alphabetical order and numbered from 0 sequentially increasing and will mail 
this to the IETF and IETF-Announce list on or before the 17th of September.  

2) The sales volume figure for the NASDAQ most active stock on the 19th of 
Sept will be used to provide an initial offset into the list.  The 10,000s and 
1,000s digit from the volume figure will be used to generate a "random" number 
from 00 to 99 (e.g. if the sales figure is 345,009,234 shares, the number is 
09).  The actual offset into the list is calculated as  volnumber**5 mod the 
length of the list.  So if the volume number is 9, the length of the list is 
47, the offset would be 17.  

3) Each stock in turn will then be used to select a nomcom member from the 
list by using the same procedure of extracting the 10,000 and 1000 digits, 
raising them to the 5th power, adding that to the current position number and 
then taking that mod the length of the list.  So if the first of the listed 
stocks sales figure was 45,923,213 and the length of the list were 47 as 
above, then the volume number would be 23, and the final position on the list 
would be (17 + 23**5) mod 47 or 39.  The person with the number 39 
(remembering that the list is numbered from 0 this is actually the 40th 
person) would become the first member.

4) Step three is repeated continuing from the current position on the list 
until all 10 members are selected.

5) In the event that there is a duplicate selection,simply continue down the 
list sequentially until you find a person who has not been selected.  Continue 
the process from that position on the list.

6) If the most active stock is also one of the stocks I list for the 
selection, it will be used twice, once for the initial offset, and once for 
selecting a member.

7) The figures as reported in the SJMercury News are the official figures.  In 
the event of a disagreement between the numbers in the SJMercury and any other 
publication, the SJMercury figures will be considered correct.

8) If any stock is not listed in the 20 September 1997 edition of the paper, 
OR HAS LESS THAN 100,000 in sales for the day, 
it will be replaced in order by one of the alternate stocks IN ITS PLACE - 
e.g. the other stocks on the list will retain their specific positions, rather 
than having the stock deleted and having the alternate stock added to the end 
of the list.

9) The list of stocks is as follows:

Member 1) Apple Computer (reported as AppleC)
	2) TCI Incorporated - Ticker: TCOMA (Replaces @Home)
	3) Cisco Systems (reported as Cisco)
	4) Cyber Cash 	(reported as CybrCsh)
	5) Excite	(reported as Excite)
	6) Intel	(reported as Intel)
	7) MCI	(reported as MCI)
	8) Microsoft (reported as Microsft)
	9) Netcom (reported as Netcom)
	10) Netscape 	(reported as Netscpe)
